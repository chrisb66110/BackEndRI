well known documents of similarnature i often get email requests from enthusiastic network newbiesasking can i learn to be a wizardly hacker back i noticed that there didn t seem to be any other faqs or webdocuments that addressed this vital question so i started thisone a lot of hackers now consider it definitive and i suppose that means it is still i don t claim to be the exclusiveauthority on this topic if you don t like what you read here writeyour own if you are reading a snapshot of this document offline thecurrent version lives at http catb org faqs hacker howto html note there is a

varying degrees the five dots in nine squares diagram that decorates thisdocument is called a glider it is a simplepattern with some surprising properties in a mathematical simulationcalled life that has fascinated hackers for many years i think it makes a goodvisual emblem for what hackers are like abstract at first abit mysterious seeming but a gateway to a whole world with anintricate logic of its own read more about the glider emblem here what is a hacker the jargonfile contains a bunch of definitions of the term hacker most having to do with technical adeptness and a delight in solvingproblems and overcoming limits if you want to know how to become a hacker though only two are reallyrelevant there is a community a shared culture of expert programmers andnetworking wizards that traces its history back through decades to thefirst time sharing minicomputers and the earliest arpanet experiments the members of this culture originated the term hacker hackersbuilt the internet hackers made the unix operating system what it istoday hackers run usenet hackers make the world wide web work ifyou are part of this culture if you have contributed to it and otherpeople in it know who you are and call you a hacker you re ahacker the hacker mind set is not confined to this software hackerculture there are people who apply the hacker attitude to otherthings like electronics or music actually you can find it atthe highest levels of any science or art software hackers recognizethese kindred spirits elsewhere and may call themhackers too and some claim that the hackernature is really independent of the particular medium the hacker worksin but in the rest of this document we will focus on the skills andattitudes of software hackers and the traditions of the sharedculture that originated the term hacker there is another group of people who loudly call themselveshackers but aren t these are people adolescent whoget a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phonesystem real hackers call these people crackers andwant nothing to do with them real hackers mostly think crackers arelazy irresponsible and not very bright and object that being ableto break security doesn t make you a hacker any more than being ableto hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer unfortunately manyjournalists and writers have been fooled into using the wordhacker to describe crackers this irritates real hackersno end the basic difference is this hackers build things crackersbreak them if you want to be a hacker keep reading if you want to be a cracker go read the alt 2600 newsgroup and getready to do five to ten in the slammer after finding out you aren t assmart as you think you are and that s all i m going to say aboutcrackers the hacker attitude 1 the world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved 2 no problem should ever have to be solved twice 3 boredom and drudgery are evil 4 freedom is good 5 attitude is no substitute for competence hackers solve problems and build things and they believe in freedomand voluntary mutual help to be accepted as a hacker you have tobehave as though you have this kind of attitude yourself and tobehave as though you have the attitude you have to really believe theattitude but if you think of cultivating hacker attitudes as just a wayto gain acceptance in the culture you ll miss the point becomingthe kind of person who believes these things is important for you for helping you learn and keeping youmotivated as with all creative arts the most effective way tobecome a master is to imitate the mind set of masters not justintellectually but emotionally as well or as the following modern zen poem has it tofollowthepath looktothemaster followthemaster walkwiththemaster seethroughthemaster becomethemaster so if you want to be a hacker repeat the following things untilyou believe them 1 the world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved being a hacker is lots of fun but it s a kind of fun that takeslots of effort the effort takes motivation successful athletes gettheir motivation from a kind of physical delight in making theirbodies perform in pushing themselves past their own physical limits similarly to be a hacker you have to get a basic thrill from solvingproblems sharpening your skills and exercising yourintelligence if you aren t the kind of person that feels this way naturally you llneed to become one in order to make it as a hacker otherwise you llfind your hacking energy is sapped by distractions like sex money andsocial approval also have to develop a kind of faith in your own learningcapacity a belief that even though you may not know all of what youneed to solve a problem if you tackle just a piece of it and learnfrom that you ll learn enough to solve the next piece and so on until you re done 2 no problem should ever have to be solved twice creative brains are a valuable limited resource they shouldn t bewasted on re inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinatingnew problems waiting out there to behave like a hacker you have to believe that the thinking time ofother hackers is precious so much so that it s almost a moral dutyfor you to share information solve problems and then give thesolutions away just so other hackers can solve new problems instead of having to perpetually re address old ones note however that problem should ever have to be solvedtwice does not imply that you have to consider all existingsolutions sacred or that there is only one right solution to anygiven problem often we learn a lot about the problem that we didn tknow before by studying the first cut at a solution it s ok andoften necessary to decide that we can do better what s not ok isartificial technical legal or institutional barriers source that prevent a good solution from being re usedand force people to re invent wheels don t have to believe that you re obligated to give all your creative product away though thehackers that do are the ones that get most respect from other hackers it s consistent with hacker values to sell enough of it to keep you infood and rent and computers it s fine to use your hacking skills tosupport a family or even get rich as long as you don t forget yourloyalty to your art and your fellow hackers while doing it 3 boredom and drudgery are evil hackers creative people in should never be bored or haveto drudge at stupid repetitive work because when this happens itmeans they aren t doing what only they can do solve new problems this wastefulness hurts everybody therefore boredom and drudgery arenot just unpleasant but actually evil to behave like a hacker you have to believe this enough to want toautomate away the boring bits as much as possible not just foryourself but for everybody else other is one apparent exception to this hackers willsometimes do things that may seem repetitive or boring to an observeras a mind clearing exercise or in order to acquire a skill or havesome particular kind of experience you can t have otherwise but thisis by choice nobody who can think should ever be forced into asituation that bores them 4 freedom is good hackers are naturally anti authoritarian anyone who can give youorders can stop you from solving whatever problem you re beingfascinated by and given the way authoritarian minds work willgenerally find some appallingly stupid reason to do so so theauthoritarian attitude has to be fought wherever you find it lestit smother you and other hackers isn t the same as fighting all authority children need to beguided and criminals restrained a hacker may agree to accept somekinds of authority in order to get something he wants more than thetime he spends following orders but that s a limited consciousbargain the kind of personal surrender authoritarians want is not onoffer authoritarians thrive on censorship and secrecy and theydistrust voluntary cooperation and information sharing theyonly like cooperation that they control so to behavelike a hacker you have to develop an instinctive hostility tocensorship secrecy and the use of force or deception to compelresponsible adults and you have to be willing to act on thatbelief 5 attitude is no substitute for competence to be a hacker you have to develop some of these attitudes butcopping an attitude alone won t make you a hacker any more than itwill make you a champion athlete or a rock star becoming a hackerwill take intelligence practice dedication and hard work therefore you have to learn to distrust attitude and respectcompetence of every kind hackers won t let posers waste their time but they worship competence especially competence at hacking butcompetence at anything is valued competence at demanding skills thatfew can master is especially good and competence at demanding skillsthat involve mental acuteness craft and concentration is best if you revere competence you ll enjoy developing it in yourself the hard work and dedication will become a kind of intense playrather than drudgery that attitude is vital to becoming ahacker basic hacking skills 1 learn how to program 2 get one of the open source unixes and learn to use and run it 3 learn how to use the world wide web and write html 4 if you don t have functional english learn it the hacker attitude is vital but skills are even more vital attitude is no substitute for competence and there s a certain basictoolkit of skills which you have to have before any hacker will dreamof calling you one this toolkit changes slowly over time as technology creates new skillsand makes old ones obsolete for example it used to include programmingin machine language and didn t until recently involve html butright now it pretty clearly includes the following 1 learn how to program this of course is the fundamental hacking skill if you don tknow any computer languages i recommend starting with python it iscleanly designed well documented and relatively kind to beginners despite being a good first language it is not just a toy it is verypowerful and flexible and well suited for large projects i havewritten a more detailed evaluationof python good tutorials are available at the python web site i used to recommend java as a good language to learn early but thiscritique has changed my mind for the pitfalls ofjava as a first programming language within a hackercannot as they devastatingly put it approach problem solvinglike a plumber in a hardware store you have to know what thecomponents actually do now i think it isprobably best to learn c and lisp first then java there is perhaps a more general point here if a language does toomuch for you it may be simultaneously a good tool for production anda bad one for learning it s not only languages that have thisproblem web application frameworks like rubyonrails cakephp djangomay make it too easy to reach a superficial sort of understanding thatwill leave you without resources when you have to tackle a hardproblem or even just debug the solution to an easy one if you get into serious programming you will have to learn c the core language of unix c is very closely related to c if youknow one learning the other will not be difficult neither languageis a good one to try learning as your first however and actually the more you can avoid programming in c the more productive you willbe c is very efficient and very sparing of your machine sresources unfortunately c gets that efficiency by requiring you todo a lot of low level management of resources by hand all that low level code is complex and bug prone and will soak uphuge amounts of your time on debugging with today s machines aspowerful as they are this is usually a bad tradeoff it s smarterto use a language that uses the machine s time less efficiently butyour time much more efficiently thus python other languages of particular importance to hackers include perl and lisp perl is worthlearning for practical reasons it s very widely used for active webpages and system administration so that even if you never write perlyou should learn to read it many people use perl in the way i suggest you should use python to avoid c programming on jobs thatdon t require c s machine efficiency you will need to be ableto understand their code lisp is worth learning for a different reason theprofound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally getit that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest ofyour days even if you never actually use lisp itself a lot canget some beginning experience with lisp fairly easily by writing andmodifying editing modes for the emacs text editor or script fuplugins for the gimp it s best actually to learn all five of python c c java perl and lisp besides being the most important hacking languages they represent very different approaches to programming and each willeducate you in valuable ways but be aware that you won t reach the skill level of a hacker oreven merely a programmer simply by accumulating languages youneed to learn how to think about programming problems in a generalway independent of any one language to be a real hacker you needto get to the point where you can learn a new language in days byrelating what s in the manual to what you already know this meansyou should learn several very different languages i can t give complete instructions on how to learn to programhere it s a complex skill but i can tell you that books andcourses won t do it many maybe most of the besthackers are self taught you can learn language features bits ofknowledge from books but the mind set that makes that knowledgeinto living skill can be learned only by practice and apprenticeship what will do it is reading code and writing code peter norvig who is one of google s top hackers and theco author of the most widely used textbook on ai has written anexcellent essay called teach yourself programming inten years his for programming is worthcareful attention learning to program is like learning to write good natural language the best way to do it is to read some stuff written by masters of theform write some things yourself read a lot more write a littlemore read a lot more write some more and repeat until yourwriting begins to develop the kind of strength and economy you see inyour models finding good code to read used to be hard because there were fewlarge programs available in source for fledgeling hackers to read andtinker with this has changed dramatically open source software programming tools and operating systems built by arenow widely available which brings me neatly to our next topic 2 get one of the open source unixes and learn to use and run it i ll assume you have a personal computer or can get access toone a moment to appreciate how much that means the hackerculture originally evolved back when computers were so expensive thatindividuals could not own them the single most important step anynewbie can take toward acquiring hacker skills is to get a copy oflinux or one of the bsd unixes or opensolaris install it on apersonal machine and run it yes there are other operating systems in the world besidesunix but they re distributed in binary you can t read thecode and you can t modify it trying to learn to hack on a microsoftwindows machine or under any other closed source system is like tryingto learn to dance while wearing a body cast under mac os x it s possible but only part of the system is opensource you re likely to hit a lot of walls and you have to becareful not to develop the bad habit of depending on apple sproprietary code if you concentrate on the unix under the hoodyou can learn some useful things unix is the operating system of the internet while you canlearn to use the internet without knowing unix you can t be aninternet hacker without understanding unix for this reason the hackerculture today is pretty strongly unix centered wasn t alwaystrue and some old time hackers still aren t happy about it but thesymbiosis between unix and the internet has become strong enough thateven microsoft s muscle doesn t seem able to seriously dent it so bring up a unix i like linux myself but there are otherways yes you can run both linux andmicrosoft windows on the same learn it run it tinker with it talk to the internet with it read the code modify the code you ll get better programming tools c lisp python than any microsoft operating system can dream of hosting you llhave fun and you ll soak up more knowledge than you realize you relearning until you look back on it as a master hacker for more about learning unix see the loginataka you mightalso want to have a look at theart of unix programming to get your hands on a linux see the linux online site you candownload from there or find a local linux user group tohelp you with installation during the first ten years of this howto s life i reported thatfrom a new user s point of view all linux distributions are almostequivalent but in 2006 2007 an actual best choice emerged ubuntu while other distros havetheir own areas of strength ubuntu is far and away the mostaccessible to linux newbies you can find bsd unix help and resources at www bsd org a good way to dip your toes in the water is to boot up whatlinux fans call a livecd a distribution that runs entirely off a cd without havingto modify your hard disk this will be slow because cds are slow but it s a way to get a look at the possibilities without havingto do anything drastic i have written a primer on the basicsof unix and the internet i used to recommend against installing either linux or bsd as asolo project if you re a newbie nowadays the installers have gottengood enough that doing it entirely on your own is possible even for anewbie nevertheless i still recommend making contact with your locallinux user s group and asking for help it can t hurt andmay smooth the process 3 learn how to use the world wide web and write html most of the things the hacker culture has built do their workout of sight helping run factories and offices and universitieswithout any obvious impact on how non hackers live the web is theone big exception the huge shiny hacker toy that even politicians admit has changed the world forthis reason alone a lot of other good ones as you need tolearn how to work the web this doesn t just mean learning how to drive a browser can but learning how to write html the web s markup language ifyou don t know how to program writing html will teach you somemental habits that will help you learn so build a home page try to stick to xhtml which is a cleaner language than classic html are good beginner tutorials on the web here s one but just having a home page isn t anywhere near good enough tomake you a hacker the web is full of home pages most of them arepointless zero content sludge very snazzy looking sludge mindyou but sludge all the same more on this see the html hellpage to be worthwhile your page must have content it must be interesting and or usefulto other hackers and that brings us to the next topic 4 if you don t have functional english learn it as an american and native english speaker myself i havepreviously been reluctant to suggest this lest it be taken as a sortof cultural imperialism but several native speakers of otherlanguages have urged me to point out that english is the workinglanguage of the hacker culture and the internet and that you will need to know it to function in the hacker community back around 1991 i learned that many hackers who have english asa second language use it in technical discussions even when they sharea birth tongue it was reported to me at the time that english has aricher technical vocabulary than any other language and is thereforesimply a better tool for the job for similar reasons translationsof technical books written in english are often unsatisfactory get done at linus torvalds a finn comments his code in english never occurred to him to do his fluencyin english has been an important factor in his ability to recruita worldwide community of developers for linux it s an example worthfollowing being a native english speaker does not guarantee that you havelanguage skills good enough to function as a hacker if your writingis semi literate ungrammatical and riddled with misspellings many hackers will tend to ignore you while sloppywriting does not invariably mean sloppy thinking we ve generallyfound the correlation to be strong and we have no use forsloppy thinkers if you can t yet write competently learn to status in the hacker culture 1 write open source software 2 help test and debug open source software 3 publish useful information 4 help keep the infrastructure working 5 serve the hacker culture itself like most cultures without a money economy hackerdom runs onreputation you re trying to solve interesting problems but howinteresting they are and whether your solutions are really good issomething that only your technical peers or superiors are normallyequipped to judge accordingly when you play the hacker game you learn to keepscore primarily by what other hackers think of your skill is whyyou aren t really a hacker until other hackers consistently call this fact is obscured by the image of hacking as solitary work also by a hacker cultural taboo decaying since the but still against admitting that ego or externalvalidation are involved in one s motivation at all specifically hackerdom is what anthropologists call a giftculture you gain status and reputation in it not by dominatingother people nor by being beautiful nor by having things otherpeople want but rather by giving things away specifically bygiving away your time your creativity and the results of yourskill there are basically five kinds of things you can do to be respected byhackers 1 write open source software the first most central and most is to writeprograms that other hackers think are fun or useful and give theprogram sources away to the whole hacker culture to use used to call these works free software but thisconfused too many people who weren t sure exactly what free wassupposed to mean most of us now prefer the term open source hackerdom s most revered demigods are people who have written large capable programs that met a widespread need and given them away sothat now everyone uses them but there s a bit of a fine historical point here whilehackers have always looked up to the open source developers among themas our community s hardest core before the mid most hackersmost of the time worked on closed source this was still true when iwrote the first version of this howto in 1996 it took themainstreaming of open source software after 1997 to change things today hacker and source are twodescriptions for what is essentially the same culture and population but it is worth remembering that this was not alwaysso more on this see the section called historical note hacking open source and free software 2 help test and debug open source software they also serve who stand and debug open source software inthis imperfect world we will inevitably spend most of our softwaredevelopment time in the debugging phase that s why any open sourceauthor who s thinking will tell you that good beta testers knowhow to describe symptoms clearly localize problems well can toleratebugs in a quickie release and are willing to apply a few simplediagnostic are worth their weight in rubies even one ofthese can make the difference between a debugging phase that s aprotracted exhausting nightmare and one that s merely a salutarynuisance if you re a newbie try to find a program under development thatyou re interested in and be a good beta tester there s a naturalprogression from helping test programs to helping debug them tohelping modify them you ll learn a lot this way and generategood karma with people who will help you later on 3 publish useful information another good thing is to collect and filter useful andinteresting information into web pages or documents like frequently asked questions lists and make those generallyavailable maintainers of major technical faqs get almost as much respect asopen source authors 4 help keep the infrastructure working the hacker culture the engineering development of theinternet for that is run by volunteers there s a lot ofnecessary but unglamorous work that needs done to keep itgoing administering mailing lists moderating newsgroups maintaining large software archive sites developing rfcs and othertechnical standards people who do this sort of thing well get a lot of respect becauseeverybody knows these jobs are huge time sinks and not as much fun asplaying with code doing them shows dedication 5 serve the hacker culture itself finally you can serve and propagate the culture itself forexample writing an accurate primer on how to become a hacker this is not something you ll be positioned to do until you ve beenaround for while and become well known for one of the first fourthings the hacker culture doesn t have leaders exactly but it does haveculture heroes and tribal elders and historians and spokespeople when you ve been in the trenches long enough you may grow into one ofthese beware hackers distrust blatant ego in their tribal elders so visibly reaching for this kind of fame is dangerous rather thanstriving for it you have to sort of position yourself so it drops inyour lap and then be modest and gracious about your status the hacker nerd connection contrary to popular myth you don t have to be a nerd to be ahacker it does help however and many hackers are in fact nerds being something of a social outcast helps you stay concentrated on thereally important things like thinking and hacking for this reason many hackers have adopted the labelgeek as a badge of pride it s a way of declaringtheir independence from normal social expectations well as afondness for other things like science fiction and strategy games thatoften go with being a the term nerd used to be used thisway back in the back when nerd was a mild pejorative and geek a rather harsher one sometime after 2000 they switched places at least in u s popular culture and there is now even a significantgeek pride culture among people who aren t techies if you can manage to concentrate enough on hacking to be good at itand still have a life that s fine this is a lot easier today thanit was when i was a newbie in the mainstream culture is muchfriendlier to techno nerds now there are even growing numbers ofpeople who realize that hackers are often high quality lover andspouse material if you re attracted to hacking because you don t have a life that s ok too at least you won t have trouble concentrating maybeyou ll get a life later on points for style again to be a hacker you have to enter the hacker mindset thereare some things you can do when you re not at a computer that seem tohelp they re not substitutes for hacking but manyhackers do them and feel that they connect in some basic waywith the essence of hacking learn to write your native language well though it s a common stereotype that programmers can t write a surprising number of hackers all the most accomplished ones i know are very able writers read science fiction go to science fiction conventions good way to meet hackers and proto train in a martial arts form the kind of mental discipline required for martial arts seems to be similar in important ways to what hackers do the most popular forms among hackers are definitely asian empty hand arts such as tae kwon do various forms of karate kung fu aikido or ju jitsu western fencing and asian sword arts also have visible followings in places where it s legal pistol shooting has been rising in popularity since the late the most hackerly martial arts are those which emphasize mental discipline relaxed awareness and control rather than raw strength athleticism or physical toughness study an actual meditation discipline the perennial favorite among hackers is zen it is possible to benefit from zen without acquiring a religion or discarding one you already other styles may work as well but be careful to choose one that doesn t require you to believe crazy things develop an analytical ear for music learn to appreciate peculiar kinds of music learn to play some musical instrument well or how to sing develop your appreciation of puns and wordplay the more of these things you already do the more likely it is that youare natural hacker material why these things in particular is notcompletely clear but they re connected with a mix of left andright brain skills that seems to be important hackers need tobe able to both reason logically and step outside the apparentlogic of a problem at a moment s notice work as intensely as you play and play as intensely as you work for true hackers the boundaries between all tend to disappear or to merge into a high level creativeplayfulness also don t be content with a narrow range of skills though most hackers self describe as programmers they are very likelyto be more than competent in several related skills systemadministration web design and pc hardware troubleshooting are commonones a hacker who s a system administrator on the other hand islikely to be quite skilled at script programming and web design hackers don t do things by halves if they invest in a skill at all they tend to get very good at it finally a few things not todo don t use a silly grandiose user id or screen name don t get in flame wars on usenet anywhere don t call yourself a cyberpunk and don t waste your time on anybody who does don t post or email writing that s full of spelling errors and bad grammar the only reputation you ll make doing any of these things is as atwit hackers have long memories it could take you years to liveyour early blunders down enough to be accepted the problem with screen names or handles deserves someamplification concealing your identity behind a handle is a juvenileand silly behavior characteristic of crackers warez and otherlower life forms hackers don t do this they re proud of what theydo and want it associated with their real names so if you have a handle drop it in the hacker culture it will onlymark you as a loser historical note hacking open source and free software when i originally wrote this how to in late 1996 some of theconditions around it were very different from the way they look today a few words about these changes may help clarify matters for peoplewho are confused about the relationship of open source freesoftware and linux to the hacker community if you are not curiousabout this you can skip straight to the faq and bibliography fromhere the hacker ethos and community as i have described it here longpredates the emergence of linux after 1990 i first became involvedwith it around 1976 and its roots are readily traceable back to theearly but before linux most hacking was done on eitherproprietary operating systems or a handful of quasi experimentalhomegrown systems like mit s its that were never deployed outside oftheir original academic niches while there had been some attempts to change this situation their impact was atbest very marginal and confined to communities of dedicated truebelievers which were tiny minorities even within the hacker community let alone with respect to the larger world of software ingeneral what is now called goes back as far as the hackercommunity does but until 1985 it was an unnamed folk practice ratherthan a conscious movement with theories and manifestos attached to it this prehistory ended when in 1985 arch hacker richard tried to give it a name but his actof naming was also an act of claiming he attached ideological baggageto the label which much of the existing hackercommunity never accepted as a result the label wasloudly rejected by a substantial minority of the hacker among those associated with bsd and used withserious but silent reservations by a majority of the despite these reservations rms s claim to define and lead thehacker community under the banner broadly held untilthe mid it was seriously challenged only by the rise of linux linux gave open source development a natural home many projectsissued under terms we would now call open source migrated fromproprietary unixes to linux the community around linux grewexplosively becoming far larger and more heterogenous than thepre linux hacker culture rms determinedly attempted to co opt allthis activity into his movement but was thwarted byboth the exploding diversity of the linux community and the publicskepticism of its founder linus torvalds torvalds continued to usethe term for lack of any alternative but publiclyrejected rms s ideological baggage many younger hackers followedsuit in 1996 when i first published this hacker howto the hackercommunity was rapidly reorganizing around linux and a handful of otheropen source operating systems those descended from community memory of the fact that most of us had spent decadesdeveloping closed source software on closed source operating systemshad not yet begun to fade but that fact was already beginning to seemlike part of a dead past hackers were increasingly definingthemselves as hackers by their attachments to open source projectssuch as linux or apache the term however had not yet emerged it wouldnot do so until early 1998 when it did most of hacker communityadopted it within the following six months the exceptions were aminority ideologically attached to the term and especially after about 2003 the identification of hacking with open source free development has becomeextremely close today there is little point in attempting todistinguish between these categories and it seems unlikely that willchange in the future it is worth remembering however that this was not always so other resources paul graham has written an essay called great hackers andanother on undergraduation in which he speaks much wisdom there is a document called how to bea programmer that is an excellent complement to this one ithas valuable advice not just about coding and skillsets but abouthow to function on a programming team i have also written abrief history of hackerdom i have written a paper the cathedraland the bazaar which explains a lot about how thelinux and open source cultures work i have addressed this topic evenmore directly in its sequel homesteadingthe noosphere rick moen has written an excellent document on how to runa linux user group rick moen and i have collaborated on another document on howto ask smart questions this will help you seek assistancein a way that makes it more likely that you will actually get it if you need instruction in the basics of how personal computers unix and the internet work see the unix and internet fundamentals howto when you release software or write patches for software try tofollow the guidelines in the software release practice howto if you enjoyed the zen poem you might also like rootless

microsoft q but won t open source software leave programmers unable to make a living q where can i get a free unix q how do i tell if i am already a hacker a ask yourself the following three questions do you speak code fluently do you identify with the goals and values of the hacker community has a well established member of the hacker community ever called you a hacker if you can answer yes to all three of thesequestions you are already a hacker no two alone are sufficient the first test is about skills you probably pass it if youhave the minimum technical skills described earlier in this document you blow right through it if you have had a substantial amount of codeaccepted by an open source development project the second test is about attitude if the five principles of the hacker mindset seemedobvious to you more like a description of the way you already livethan anything novel you are already halfway to passing it that s theinward half the other outward half is the degree to which youidentify with the hacker community s long term projects here is an incomplete but indicative list of some of thoseprojects does it matter to you that linux improve and spread are youpassionate about software freedom hostile to monopolies do you acton the belief that computers can be instruments of empowerment thatmake the world a richer and more humane place but a note of caution is in order here the hacker community hassome specific primarily defensive political interests two ofthem are defending free speech rights and fending power grabs that would make open sourceillegal some of those long term projects are civil libertiesorganizations like the electronic frontier foundation and theoutward attitude properly includes support of them but beyond that most hackers view attempts to systematize the hacker attitude into anexplicit political program with suspicion we ve learned the hardway that these attempts are divisive and distracting if someonetries to recruit you to march on your capitol in the name of thehacker attitude they ve missed the point the right response isprobably shut up and show them the code the third test has a tricky element of recursiveness about it i observed in the section called what is a hacker that being a hacker is partly amatter of belonging to a particular subculture or social network witha shared history an inside and an outside in the far past hackerswere a much less cohesive and self aware group than they are today but the importance of the social network aspect has increased overthe last thirty years as the internet has made connections with thecore of the hacker subculture easier to develop and maintain one easybehavioral index of the change is that in this century we have ourown t shirts sociologists who study networks like those of the hackerculture under the general rubric of have notedthat one characteristic of such networks is that they have gatekeepers core members with the social authority to endorse new membersinto the network because the that is hackerculture is a loose and informal one the role of gatekeeper isinformal too but one thing that all hackers understand in theirbones is that not every hacker is a gatekeeper gatekeepers have tohave a certain degree of seniority and accomplishment before they canbestow the title how much is hard to quantify but every hacker knowsit when they see it q will you teach me how to hack a since first publishing this page i ve gotten several requests aweek several a from people to me all unfortunately i don t have the time or energy to do this my own hacking projects and working as an open source advocate take up of my time even if i did hacking is an attitude and skill you basically have toteach yourself you ll find that while real hackers want to help you they won t respect you if you beg to be spoon fed everything theyknow learn a few things first show that you re trying that you recapable of learning on your own then go to the hackers you meet withspecific questions if you do email a hacker asking for advice here are two thingsto know up front first we ve found that people who are lazy orcareless in their writing are usually too lazy and careless in theirthinking to make good hackers so take care to spell correctly anduse good grammar and punctuation otherwise you ll probably beignored secondly don t dare ask for a reply toan isp account that s different from the account you re sending from we find people who do that are usually thieves using stolen accounts and we have no interest in rewarding or assisting thievery q how can i get started then a the best way for you to get started would probably be to go to a user meeting you can find such groups on the ldp general linuxinformation page there is probably one near you possiblyassociated with a college or university lug members will probablygive you a linux if you ask and will certainly help you install oneand get started q when do you have to start is it too late for me to learn a any age at which you are motivated to start is a good age most peopleseem to get interested between ages 15 and 20 but i know ofexceptions in both directions q how long will it take me to learn to hack a that depends on how talented you are and how hard you work atit most people who try can acquire a respectable skill set in eighteenmonths to two years if they concentrate don t think it ends there though in hacking in many other it takes about ten yearsto achieve mastery and if you are a real hacker you will spend the restof your life learning and perfecting your craft q is visual basic a good language to start with a if you re asking this question it almost certainly means you rethinking about trying to hack under microsoft windows this is a badidea in itself when i compared trying to learn to hack under windowsto trying to learn to dance while wearing a body cast i wasn tkidding don t go there it s ugly and it never stops beingugly there is a specific problem with visual basic mainlythat it s not portable though there is a prototype open sourceimplementations of visual basic the applicable ecma standardsdon t cover more than a small set of its programming interfaces onwindows most of its library support is proprietary to a singlevendor if you aren t extremely careful about which features you use more careful than anynewbie is really capable of being you ll end up locked intoonly those platforms microsoft chooses to support if you restarting on a unix much better languages with better libraries are available python for example also like other basics visual basic is apoorly designed language that will teach you bad programminghabits no don t ask me to describe them indetail that explanation would fill a book learn a well designedlanguage instead one of those bad habits is becoming dependent on a singlevendor s libraries widgets and development tools in general anylanguage that isn t fully supported under at least linux or one of the bsds and or at least three different vendors operating systems is a poorone to learn to hack in q would you help me to crack a system or teach me how to crack a no anyone who can still ask such a question after reading this faqis too stupid to be educable even if i had the time for tutoring any emailed requests of this kind that i get will be ignored oranswered with extreme rudeness q how can i get the password for someone else s account a this is cracking go away idiot q how can i break into read monitor someone else s email a this is cracking get lost moron q how can i steal channel op privileges on irc a this is cracking begone cretin q i ve been cracked will you help me fend off further attacks a no every time i ve been asked this question so far it s beenfrom some poor sap running microsoft windows it is not possible toeffectively secure windows systems against crack attacks the code andarchitecture simply have too many flaws which makes securing windowslike trying to bail out a boat with a sieve the only reliableprevention starts with switching to linux or some other operatingsystem that is designed to at least be capable of security q i m having problems with my windows software will you help me a yes go to a dos prompt and type c any problems you are experiencing will cease within a few minutes q where can i find some real hackers to talk with a the best way is to find a unix or linux user s group local to you andgo to their meetings can find links to several lists of usergroups on the ldp site used to say here that you wouldn t find any real hackers on irc but i m given to understand this is changing apparently some realhacker communities attached to things like gimp and perl have ircchannels now q can you recommend useful books about hacking related subjects a i maintain a linux reading list howto that you may find helpful the loginataka may also be interesting for an introduction to python see the tutorial on the python site q do i need to be good at math to become a hacker a no hacking uses very little formal mathematics or arithmetic in particular you won t usually need trigonometry calculus oranalysis are exceptions to this in a handful of specificapplication areas like 3 d computer knowing some formal logicand boolean algebra is good some grounding in finite finite set theory combinatorics and graph can behelpful much more importantly you need to be able to think logicallyand follow chains of exact reasoning the way mathematicians do while the content of most mathematics won t help you you will needthe discipline and intelligence to handle mathematics if you lackthe intelligence there is little hope for you as a hacker if youlack the discipline you d better grow it i think a good way to find out if you have what it takes is to pickup a copy of raymond smullyan s book what is the name ofthis book smullyan s playful logical conundrums are verymuch in the hacker spirit being able to solve them is a good sign enjoying solving them is an even better one q what language should i learn first a xhtml latest dialect of if you don t already know it there are a lot of glossy hype intensive bad html books out there and distressingly few good ones the one i likebest is html thedefinitive guide but html is not a full programming language when you re readyto start programming i would recommend starting with python you will hear a lot ofpeople recommending perl but it s harder to learn and my well designed c is really important but it s also much more difficult than eitherpython or perl don t try to learn it first windows users do not settle for visualbasic it will teach you bad habits and it s not portable offwindows avoid q what kind of hardware do i need a it used to be that personal computers were rather underpowered andmemory poor enough so that they placed artificial limits on a hacker slearning process this stopped being true in the mid any machinefrom an intel 486 up is more than powerful enough for developmentwork x and internet communications and the smallest disks you canbuy today are plenty big enough the important thing in choosing a machine on which to learn iswhether its hardware is linux compatible bsd compatible shouldyou choose to go that again this will be true for almost allmodern machines the only really sticky areas are modems and wirelesscards some machines have windows specific hardware that won t workwith linux there s a faq on hardware compatibility the latest version is here q i want to contribute can you help me pick a problem to work on a no because i don t know your talents or interests you haveto be self motivated or you won t stick which is why having otherpeople choose your direction almost never works try this watch the project announcements scroll by on freshmeat for a few days when you see one that makes you think i d like to work onthat join it q do i need to hate and bash microsoft a no you don t not that microsoft isn t loathsome but there was ahacker culture long before microsoft and there will still be one long aftermicrosoft is history any energy you spend hating microsoft wouldbe better spent on loving your craft write good code that willbash microsoft quite sufficiently without polluting your karma q but won t open source software leave programmers unable to make a living a this seems unlikely so far the open source softwareindustry seems to be creating jobs rather than taking them away ifhaving a program written is a net economic gain over not having itwritten a programmer will get paid whether or not the program isgoing to be open source after it s done and no matter how software gets written there always seems to be more demand fornew and customized applications i ve written more about this at the open source pages q where can i get a free unix a if you don t have a unix installed on your machine yet elsewhere on this page i include pointers to where to get the mostcommonly used free unix to be a hacker you need motivation andinitiative and the ability to educate yourself start now
