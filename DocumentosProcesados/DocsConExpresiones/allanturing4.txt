wide interest it has inspired his mother s memoir s turing a detailedbiography a play and television film and various other works of fiction and art there are many reasons for this interest but one is that in everysphere of his life and work he made unexpected connections betweenapparently unrelated areas his central contribution to science andphilosophy came through his treating the subject of symbolic logic as anew branch of applied mathematics giving it a physical and engineeringcontent unwilling or unable to remain within any standard role ordepartment of thought alan turing continued a life full ofincongruity though a shy boyish man he had a pivotal role in worldhistory through his role in second world war cryptology though thefounder of the dominant technology of the twentieth century hevariously impressed charmed or disturbed people with his unworldlyinnocence and his dislike of moral or intellectual compromise alan mathison turing was born in london 23 june 1912 toupper middle class british parents his schooling was of a traditionalkind dominated by the british imperial system but from earliest lifehis fascination with the scientific impulse expressed by him asfinding the commonest in found him at oddswith authority his scepticism and disrespect for worldly values werenever tamed and became ever more confidently eccentric his moodyhumour swung between gloom and vivacity his life was also notable asthat of a gay man with strong emotions and a growing insistence on hisidentity his first true home was at king s college cambridge university noted for its progressive intellectual life centred on j m keynes turing studied mathematics with increasing distinction and was electeda fellow of the college in 1935 this appointment was followed by aremarkable and sudden debut in an area where he was an unknownfigure that of mathematical logic the paper on 1936 was his first and perhaps greatesttriumph it gave a definition of computation and an absolute limitationon what computation could achieve which makes it the founding work ofmodern computer science it led him to princeton for more advanced workin logic and other branches of mathematics he had the opportunity toremain in the united states but chose to return to britain in 1938 and was immediately recruited for the british communications war from 1939 to 1945 turing was almost totally engaged in the masteryof the german enciphering machine enigma and other cryptologicalinvestigations at now famous bletchley park the british government swartime communications headquarters turing made a unique logicalcontribution to the decryption of the enigma and became the chiefscientific figure with a particular responsibility for reading theu boat communications as such he became a top level figure inanglo american liaison and also gained exposure to the most advancedelectronic technology of the day combining his ideas from mathematical logic his experience incryptology and some practical electronic knowledge his ambition atthe end of the war in europe was to create an electronic computer inthe full modern sense his plans commissioned by the national physicallaboratory london were overshadowed by the more powerfully supportedamerican projects turing also laboured under the disadvantage that hiswartime achievements remained totally secret his ideas led the fieldin 1946 but this was little recognised frustrated in his work heemerged as a powerful marathon runner and almost qualified for thebritish team in the 1948 olympic games turing s motivations were scientific rather than industrial orcommercial and he soon returned to the theoretical limitations ofcomputation this time focussing on the comparison of the power ofcomputation and the power of the human brain his contention was thatthe computer when properly programmed could rival the brain itfounded the artificial program of comingdecades in 1948 he moved to manchester university where he partly fulfilledthe expectations placed upon him to plan software for the pioneercomputer development there but still remained a free ranging thinker it was here that his famous 1950 paper computing machinery andintelligence was written in 1951 he was elected afellow of the royal society for his 1936 achievement yet at the sametime he was striking into entirely new territory with a mathematicaltheory of biological morphogenesis this work was interrupted by alan turing s arrest in february his sexual affair with a young manchester man and he was obliged to escape imprisonment to undergo the injection of oestrogen intendedto negate his sexual drive he was disqualified from continuing secretcryptological work his general libertarian attitude was enhancedrather than suppressed by the criminal trial and his intellectualindividuality also remained as lively as ever while remaining formallya reader in the theory of computing he not only embarked on moreambitious applications of his biological theory but advanced new ideasfor fundamental physics for this reason his death on 7 june 1954 at his home in wilmslow cheshire came as a general surprise in hindsight it is obvious thatturing s unique status in anglo american secret communication workmeant that there were pressures on him of which his contemporaries wereunaware there was certainly another conflictwith government in 1953 1983 p some commentators e g dawson have argued that assassination should not be ruled out but he had spoken of suicide and his death which was by cyanidepoisoning was most likely by his own hand contrived so as to allowthose who wished to do so to believe it a result of his penchant forchemistry experiments the symbolism of its dramatic element apartly eaten apple has continued to haunt the intellectual edenfrom which alan turing was expelled 2 the turing machine and computability alan turing drew much between 1928 and 1933 from the work of themathematical physicist and populariser a s eddington from j vonneumann s account of the foundations of quantum mechanics and thenfrom bertrand russell s mathematical logic meanwhile his lastingfascination with the problems of mind and matter was heightened byemotional elements in his own life 1983 p in 1934 hegraduated with an outstanding degree in mathematics from cambridgeuniversity followed by a successful dissertation in probability theorywhich won him a fellowship of king s college cambridge in 1935 thiswas the background to his learning also in 1935 of the problem whichwas to make his name it was from the lectures of the topologist m h a newman inthat year that he learnt of del s 1931 proof of the formalincompleteness of logical systems rich enough to include arithmetic and of the outstanding problem in the foundations of mathematics asposed by hilbert the wasthere a method by which it could be decided for any given mathematicalproposition whether or not it was provable the principal difficulty of this question lay in giving anunassailably correct and general definition of what was meant by suchexpressions as definite or effectiveprocedure turing worked on this alone for a year until independence and isolation was to be both his strength informulating original ideas and his weakness when it came to promotingand implementing them the word had often been used of theformalist approach lying behind hilbert s problem and turing seized onthe concept of the machine turing s solution lay in definingwhat was soon to be named the turing machine with this hedefined the concept of the in terms of simpleatomic operations the turing machine formalism was modelled on theteleprinter slightly enlarged in scope to allow a paper tape thatcould move in both directions and a that could read erase and print new symbols rather than only read and punch permanentholes the turing machine is theoretical in the sense thatit is not intended actually to be engineered being no point indoing although it is essential that its atomic components tape movement to left and right testing for the presence of are such as could actually be implemented the wholepoint of the formalism is to reduce the concept of to simple operations that can unquestionably effected nevertheless turing s purpose was to embody the most generalmechanical process as carried out by a human being hisanalysis began not with any existing computing machines but with thepicture of a child s exercise book marked off in squares from thebeginning the turing machine concept aimed to capture what the human mind can do when carrying out a procedure in speaking of turing machine it should be madeclear that there are infinitely many turing machines eachcorresponding to a different method or procedure by virtue of having adifferent table of behaviour nowadays it is almostimpossible to avoid imagery which did not exist in 1936 that of thecomputer in modern terms the table of of aturing machine is equivalent to a computer program if a turing machine corresponds to a computer program what is theanalogy of the computer it is what turing described as a universal machine 1936 p again there are infinitely many universal turing machines forming a subset ofturing machines they are those machines with tables complex enough to read the tables of other turingmachines and then do what those machines would have done if thisseems strange note the modern parallel that any computer can besimulated by software on another computer the way that tables can readand simulate the effect of other tables is crucial to turing s theory going far beyond babbage s ideas of a hundred years earlier it alsoshows why turing s ideas go to the heart of the modern computer inwhich it is essential that programs are themselves a form of data whichcan be manipulated by other programs but the reader must alwaysremember that in 1936 there were no such computers indeed the moderncomputer arose out of the formulation of that turing found in this work turing s machine formulation allowed the precise definition of the computable namely as what can be done by a turing machineacting alone more exactly computable operations are those which canbe effected by what turing called automatic machines thecrucial point here is that the action of an automatic turing machine istotally determined by its table of allowed for choice which call for humaninputs rather than being totally determined turing then proposedthat this definition of captured preciselywhat was intended by such words as definite method procedure mechanical in stating the entscheidungsproblem in applying his machine concept to the entscheidungsproblem turing took the step of defining computable numbers these are those real numbers consideredas infinite decimals say which it is possible for a turing machine starting with an empty tape to print out for example the turingmachine which simply prints the digit 1 and moves to the right thenrepeats that action for ever can thereby compute the number a more complicated turing machine can compute theinfinite decimal expansion of turing machines like computer programs are countable indeed theycan be ordered in a complete list by a kind of alphabetical ordering oftheir tables of turing did this by encodingthe tables into description which can then beordered in magnitude amongst this list a subset of them description are the machines whichhave the effect of printing out infinite decimals it is readily shown using a argument first used by cantor andfamiliar from the discoveries of russell and del that there canbe no turing machine with the property of deciding whether adescription number is satisfactory or not the argument can bepresented as follows suppose that such a turing machine exists thenit is possible to construct a new turing machine which works out inturn the nth digit from the nth machine possessing a satisfactorydescription number this new machine then prints an nth digit differingfrom that digit as the machine proceeds it prints out an infinitedecimal and therefore has a descriptionnumber yet this number must by construction differ from the outputs ofevery turing machine with a satisfactory description number this is acontradiction so the hypothesis must be false 1936 p from this turing was able to answer hilbert s entscheidungsproblem in the negative there can be no suchgeneral method turing s proof can be recast in many ways but the core idea dependson the self reference involved in a machine operating onsymbols which is itself described by symbols and so can operate on itsown description indeed the self referential aspect of the theory canbe highlighted by a different form of the proof which turing 1936 p suppose that such a machine for decidingsatisfactoriness does exist then apply it to its own descriptionnumber a contradiction can readily be obtained however method has the advantage of bringing out thefollowing that a real number may be defined unambiguously yet be uncomputable it is a non trivial discovery thatwhereas some infinite decimals g may be encapsulated in afinite table other infinite decimals fact almost cannot likewise there are decision problems such as is this numberprime in which infinitely many answers are wrapped up in afinite recipe while there are others almost which arenot and must be regarded as requiring infinitely many differentmethods is this a provable proposition belongs to thelatter category this is what turing established and into the bargain the remarkablefact that anything that is computable can in fact be computedby one machine a universal turing machine it was vital to turing s work that he justified the definition byshowing that it encompassed the most general idea for if it did not the entscheidungproblem remained open there might be some morepowerful type of method than was encompassed by turing computability one justification lay in showing that the definition included manyprocesses a mathematician would consider to be natural in 1936 p another argument involved a human calculatorfollowing written instruction notes 1936 p but in abolder argument the one he placed first he considered argument appealing to the states ofmind of a human computer 1936 p the entry into his argument was highly significant but atthis stage it was only a mind following a rule to summarise turing found and justified on very general andfar reaching grounds a precise mathematical formulation of theconception of a general process or method his work as presented tonewman in april 1936 argued that his formulation encompassed the possible processeswhich can be carried out in computing a number 1936 p this opened up new fields of discovery both in practicalcomputation and in the discussion of human mental processes however although turing had worked as what newman called a 1983 p he soon learned that he was notalone in what gandy has called the confluence of ideas the princeton logician alonzo church had slightly outpaced turing infinding a satisfactory definition of what he called effectivecalculability church s definition required the logicalformalism of the lambda calculus this meant that from theoutset turing s achievement merged with and superseded the formulationof church s thesis namely the assertion that thelambda calculus formalism correctly embodied the concept of effectiveprocess or method very rapidly it was shown that the mathematicalscope of turing computability coincided with church s definition with the scope of the general recursive functions definedby turing wrote his own statement 1939 p ofthe conclusions that had been reached in 1938 it is in the ph d thesis that he wrote under church s supervision and so this statementis the nearest we have to a joint statement of the church a function is said to be if its values can be found by some purely mechanicalprocess although it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of thisidea it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite mathematically expressible definition such a definition was firstgiven by del at princeton in these functions weredescribed as general by another definition of effective calculability has been given who identifies it with lambda definability the e has recently suggested a definition corresponding moreclosely to the intuitive it was stated above that afunction is effectively calculable if its values can be found by apurely mechanical process we may take this statement literally understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carriedout by a machine it is possible to give a mathematical description ina certain normal form of the structures of these machines thedevelopment of these ideas leads to the author s definition of acomputable function and to an identification of computability witheffective calculability it is not difficult though somewhatlaborious to prove that these three definitions areequivalent church accepted that turing s definition gave a compelling intuitivereason for why church s thesis was true the recent exposition bydavis emphasises that del also was convinced by turing sargument that an absolute concept had been identified the situation has not changed since 1937 furthercomment see the article on the church turing thesis the recent selection of turing s papers edited by copeland and the review of hodges continue this discussion turing himself did little to evangelise his formulation in the worldof mathematical logic and early computer science the textbooks ofdavis and minsky did more nowadays turing computabilityis often reformulated g in terms of however computer simulations g turing s world from have brought turing soriginal imagery to life turing s work also opened new areas for decidability questionswithin pure mathematics from the turing machines also took onnew life in the development of complexity theory and as suchunderpin one of the most important research areas in computer science this development exemplifies the lasting value of turing s specialquality of giving concrete illustration to abstract concepts 3 the logical and the physical as put by gandy turing s paper was a paradigm ofphilosophical analysis refining a vague notion into a precisedefinition but it was more than being an analysis within theworld of mathematical logic in turing s thought the question thatconstantly recurs both theoretically and practically is therelationship of the logical turing machine to the physical world means doing not merely imaginingor postulating at this stage neither turing nor any other logicianmade a serious investigation into the physics of doing but turing s image of a teleprinter like machinedoes inescapably refer to something that could actually be done his concept is a distillation of the idea that onecan only one simple action or finite number of simpleactions at a time how a concept is it the tape never holds more than a finite number of marked squares atany point in a computation thus it can be thought of as being finite but always capable of further extension as required obviously thisunbounded extendibility is unphysical but the definition is still ofpractical use it means that anything done on a finite tape howeverlarge is computable himself took such a finitistic approachwhen explaining the practical relevance of computability in his one aspect of turing s formulation however involves absolutefiniteness the table of behaviour of a turing machine must be finite since turing allows only a finite number of a turing machine and only a finiterepertoire of symbols which can be marked on the tape this isessentially equivalent to allowing only computer programs with finitelengths of code calculable by finite was turing scharacterisation of computability which he justified with the argumentthat the human memory is necessarily limited p the whole point of his definition lies in encodinginfinite potential effects g the printing of an infinite finite tables of there would be no pointin allowing machines with infinite tables of it is obvious for instance that any real number could be printed bysuch a by letting the nth configuration to print the nth digit for example such could likewise store any countable number ofstatements about all possible mathematical expressions and so make the entscheidungsproblem trivial church when reviewing turing s paper while turing was inprinceton under his supervision actually gave a boldercharacterisation of the turing machine as an arbitrary finitemachine the author e proposes as a criterion that aninfinite sequence of digits 0 and 1 be that it shall bepossible to devise a computing machine occupying a finite space andwith working parts of finite size which will write down the sequenceto any desired number of terms if allowed to run for a sufficientlylong time as a matter of convenience certain further restrictions areimposed on the character of the machine but these are of such a natureas obviously to cause no loss of generality in particular ahuman calculator provided with pencil and paper and explicitinstructions can be regarded as a kind of turing machine church repeated this characterisation turing neitherendorsed it nor said anything to contradict it leaving the generalconcept of itself undefined the work of did more to justify this characterisation by refining thestatement of what is meant by a machine his resultssupport church s statement they also argue strongly for the view thatnatural attempts to extend the notion of computability lead totrivialisation if gandy s conditions on a aresignificantly weakened then every real number becomes calculable p a different interpretation of church sstatement see the article on the church turing thesis turing did not explicitly discuss the question of the speed of his elementary actions it is left implicit in his discussion byhis use of the word never that it is not possible forinfinitely many steps to be performed in a finite time others haveexplored the effect of abandoning this restriction davies forinstance describes a with an infinite number ofparts requiring components of arbitrarily small size running atarbitrarily high speeds such a could performuncomputable tasks davies emphasises that such a machine cannot bebuilt in our own physical world but argues that it could beconstructed in a universe with different physics to the extent that itrules out such the church turing thesis musthave at least some physical content true physics is quantum mechanical and this implies a differentidea of matter and action from turing s purely classical picture it isperhaps odd that turing did not point this out in this period since hewas well versed in quantum physics instead the analysis and practicaldevelopment of quantum computing was left to the quantumcomputation using the evolution of wave functions rather thanclassical machine states is the most important way in which turingmachine model has been challenged the standard formulation of quantumcomputing 1985 following feynman does not predictanything beyond computable effects although within the realm of thecomputable quantum computations may be very much more efficient thanclassical computations it is possible that a deeper understanding ofquantum mechanical physics may further change the picture of what canbe physically done 4 the uncomputable turing turned to the exploration of the uncomputable for hisprinceton ph d thesis which then appeared as systems oflogic based on ordinals it is generally the view as expressed by feferman that thiswork was a diversion from the main thrust of his work but from anotherangle as expressed in one can see turing s developmentas turning naturally from considering the mind when following a rule to the action of the mind when not following a rule inparticular this 1938 work considered the mind when seeing the truth ofone of del s true but formally unprovable propositions andhence going beyond rules based on the axioms of the system as turingexpressed it 1939 p there are formulae seenintuitively to be correct but which the del theorem shows areunprovable in the original system turing s theory ordinal was an attempt to avoid as far aspossible the effects of del s by studying theeffect of adding del sentences as new axioms to create strongerand stronger logics it did not reach a definitive conclusion in his investigation turing introduced the idea of capable of performing as if by magic anuncomputable operation turing s oracle cannot be considered as black component of a new class of machines to be puton a par with the primitive operations of reading single symbols ashas been suggested by an oracle is infinitely morepowerful than anything a modern computer can do and nothing likean elementary component of a computer turing oracle as turing machines with an additionalconfiguration in which they call the so as to takean uncomputable step but these oracle machines are not purelymechanical they are only partially mechanical like turing schoice machines indeed the whole point of the oracle machineis to explore the realm of what cannot be done by purelymechanical processes turing emphasised 1939 p we shall not go any further into the nature of this oracleapart from saying that it cannot be a machine turing s oracle can be seen simply as a mathematical tool usefulfor exploring the mathematics of the uncomputable the idea of anoracle allows the formulation of questions of relative ratherthan absolute computability thus turing opened new fields ofinvestigation in mathematical logic however there is also a possibleinterpretation in terms of human cognitive capacity on thisinterpretation the oracle is related to the involved in seeing the truth of a del statement m h a newman who introduced turing to mathematical logic and continued tocollaborate with him wrote in that the oracle resemblesa mathematician having an as opposed to using amechanical method however turing s oracle cannot actually be identified with a human mental faculty it is too powerful itimmediately supplies the answer as to whether any given turing machineis satisfactory something no human being could do onthe other hand anyone hoping to see mental captured completely by an oracle must face the difficulty that turingshowed how his argument for the incompleteness of turing machines couldbe applied with equal force to oracle machines 1939 p this point has been emphasised by penrose p newman scomment might better be taken to refer to the different oraclesuggested later on 1939 p which has the property ofrecognising ordinal formulae one can only safely saythat turing s interest at this time in uncomputable operations appearsin the general setting of studying the of truths which are not established byfollowing mechanical processes 1939 p in turing s presentation intuition is in practice present in everypart of a mathematician s thought but when mathematical proof isformalised intuition has an explicit manifestation in those stepswhere the mathematician sees the truth of a formally unprovablestatement turing did not offer any suggestion as to what he consideredthe brain was physically doing in a moment of indeed the word did notappear in his writing in this era this question is of interest becauseof the views of penrose 1990 1994 on just this issue penrose holds that the ability of the mind to see formally unprovabletruths shows that there must be uncomputable physical operations in thebrain it should be noted that there is widespread disagreement aboutwhether the human mind is really seeing the truth of a delsentence see for instance the discussion in and thereviews following it however turing s writing at this period acceptedwithout criticism the concept of intuitive recognition of thetruth it was also at this period that turing met wittgenstein and thereis a full record of their 1939 discussions on the foundations ofmathematics in to the disappointment of many there isno record of any discussions between them verbal or written on theproblem of mind in 1939 turing s various energetic investigations were broken offfor war work this did however have the positive feature of leadingturing to turn his universal machine into the practical form of themodern digital computer 5 building a universal machine when apprised in 1936 of turing s idea for a universal machine turing s contemporary and friend the economist david champernowne reacted by saying that such a thing was impractical it would the albert hall if built from relays as then employed intelephone exchanges that might indeed have been so and turing made noattempt at it however in 1937 turing did work with relays on asmaller machine with a special cryptological function 1983 p world history then led turing to his unique role in the enigmaproblem to his becoming the chief figure in the mechanisation oflogical procedures and to his being introduced to ever faster and moreambitious technology as the war continued after 1942 turing learnt that electronic components offered thespeed storage capacity and logical functions required to be effectiveas and instruction tables so from 1945 turingtried to use electronics to turn his universal machine into practicalreality turing rapidly composed a detailed plan for a modernstored program computer that is a computer in which data andinstructions are stored and manipulated alike turing s ideas led thefield although his report of 1946 postdated von neumann s more famousedvac report neumann it can however be argued as doesdavis that von neumann gained his fundamental insight into thecomputer through his pre war familiarity with turing s logical work atthe time however these basic principles were not much discussed thedifficulty of engineering the electronic hardware dominatedeverything it therefore escaped observers that turing was ahead of von neumannand everyone else on the future of software or as he called it construction of instruction tables turing foresawat once instruction tables will have to be made up bymathematicians with computing experiences and perhaps a certainpuzzle solving ability there will probably be a great deal of work tobe done for every known process has got to be translated intoinstruction table form at some stage the process of constructing instruction tables should be veryfascinating there need be no real danger of it ever becoming a drudge for any processes that are quite mechanical may be turned over to themachine itself these remarks reflecting the universality of the computer and itsability to manipulate its own instructions correctly described thefuture trajectory of the computer industry however turing had in mindsomething greater building a brain 6 building a brain the provocative words building a from the outsetannounced the relationship of turing s technical computer engineeringto a philosophy of mind even in 1936 turing had given aninterpretation of computability in terms of states his war work had shown the astounding power of thecomputable in mechanising expert human procedures and judgments onwards turing had also discussed the mechanisation ofchess playing and other activities with hiscolleagues at bletchley park 1983 p but moreprofoundly it appears that turing emerged in 1945 with a convictionthat computable operations were sufficient to embrace all mental functions performed by the brain as will become clear from theensuing discussion the uncomputable of from turing s thought and was replaced by new ideas alllying within the realm of the computable this change shows even in thetechnical prospectus of where turing referred to thepossibility of making a machine calculate chess moves and thencontinued this raises the question can a machine playchess it could fairly easily be made to play a rather bad game it would be bad because chess requires intelligence we stated that the machine should be treated as entirely without intelligence there are indications however that it is possible to make the machinedisplay intelligence at the risk of its making occasional seriousmistakes by following up this aspect the machine could probably bemade to play very good chess the puzzling reference to is made clear by atalk turing gave a year later in which the issue ofmistakes is linked to the issue of the significance of seeing the truthof formally unprovable statements i would say that fair play must be given to themachine instead of it giving no answer we could arrange that it givesoccasional wrong answers but the human mathematician would likewisemake blunders when trying out new in other wordsthen if a machine is expected to be infallible it cannot also beintelligent there are several mathematical theorems which say almostexactly that but these theorems say nothing about how muchintelligence may be displayed if a machine makes no pretence atinfallibility turing s post war view was that mathematicians make mistakes and sodo not in fact see the truth infallibly once the possibility ofmistakes is admitted del s theorem become irrelevant mathematicians and computers alike apply computable processes to theproblem of judging the correctness of assertions both will thereforesometimes err since seeing the truth is known not to be a computableoperation but there is no reason why the computer need do worse thanthe mathematician this argument is still very much alive forinstance davis endorses turing s view and attacks 1990 1994 who argues against the significance of humanerror on the grounds of a platonist account of mathematics turing also pursued more constructively the question of howcomputers could be made to perform operations which did not appear tobe use common his guidingprinciple was that it should be possible to simulate the operation ofhuman brains in an unpublished report turing explainedthat the question was that of how to simulate in addition to comparable to the needfor as well as mechanical ingenuity expressedin his pre war work he announced ideas for how to achieve this hethought could arise from systems where thealgorithm applied is not consciously designed but is arrived at bysome other means thus he now seemed to think that the mind when not actually following any conscious rule or plan wasnevertheless carrying out some computable process he suggested a range of ideas for systems which could be said tomodify their own programs these ideas included nets of logicalcomponents unorganised whose properties couldbe into a desired function thus as expressed he predicted neural networks however turing s nets didnot have the structure of the neural networksthat were to be developed from the onwards by the genetical or evolutionary he also anticipated genetic which since the late have beendeveloped as a less closely structured approach to self modifyingprograms turing s proposals were not well developed in 1948 and at atime when electronic computers were only barely in operation could nothave been fresh attention to them has been drawn by copeland andproudfoot and they have now have been tried out it is important to note that turing identified his prototype neuralnetworks and genetic algorithms as computable this has to beemphasised since the word is often nowconfusingly employed for computer operations that are not explicitlyplanned indeed his ambition was explicit he himself wanted toimplement them as programs on a computer using the term universalpractical computing machine for what is now called a digital computer he wrote in it should be easy to make a model of any particular machinethat one wishes to work on within such a upcm instead of having to workwith a paper machine as at present if one also decided on quitedefinite teaching these could also be programmedinto the machine one would then allow the whole system to run for anappreciable period and then break in as a kind of inspector and see what progress had been made one might also beable to make some progress with the upshot of this line of thought is that all mental operations are computable and hence realisable on a universal machine thecomputer turing advanced this view with increasing confidence in thelate perfectly aware that it represented what he enjoyed to the believers in minds or souls beyond materialdescription turing was not a mechanical thinker or a stickler for convention far from it of all people he knew the nature of originality andindividual independence even in tackling the u boat enigma problem for instance he declared that he did so because no one else waslooking at it and he could have it to himself far from being trainedor organised into this problem he took it on despite the prevailingwisdom in 1939 that it was too difficult to attempt his arrival at athesis of machine was not the outcome ofsome dull or restricted mentality or a lack of appreciation ofindividual human creativity 7 machine intelligence turing relished the paradox of machine anapparent contradiction in terms it is likely that he was alreadysavouring this theme in 1941 when he read a theological book by theauthor dorothy sayers in he quoted fromthis work to illustrate his full awareness that in common was used to to mean devoid ofintelligence giving a date which no doubt had his highlysophisticated enigma breaking machines secretly in mind he wrote up to only very limited machinery had been used andthis encouraged the belief that machinery was necessarilylimited to extremely straightforward possibly even to repetitious jobs his object was to dispel these connotations in 1950 turing wrote on the first page of his manual for users ofthe manchester university computer electronic computers are intended to carry out any definiterule of thumb process which could have been done by a human operatorworking in a disciplined but unintelligent manner this is of course just the 1936 universal turing machine now inelectronic form on the other hand he also wrote in the more famouspaper of that year p we may hope that machines will eventually compete with menin all purely intellectual fields how could the intelligent arise from operations which werethemselves totally routine and mindless entirely without this is the core of theproblem turing faced and the same problem faces artificialintelligence research today turing s underlying argument was that thehuman brain must somehow be organised for intelligence and that theorganisation of the brain must be realisable as a finite discrete statemachine the implications of this view were exposed to a wider circlein his famous paper computing machinery and intelligence whichappeared in mind in october 1950 the appearance of this paper turing s first foray into a journal ofphilosophy was stimulated by his discussions at manchester universitywith michael polanyi it also reflects the general sympathy of gilbertryle editor of mind with turing s point of view turing s 1950 paper was intended for a wide readership and its fresh anddirect approach has made it one of the most frequently cited and republishedpapers in modern philosophical literature not surprisingly the paper has attracted many critiques not all commentators note thecareful explication of computability which opens the paper with anemphasis on the concept of the universal machine this explains why ifmental function can be achieved by any finite discrete state machine then the same effect can be achieved by programming a computer p however that turing makes no claim that thenervous system should resemble a digital computer in its structure s treatment has a severely finitistic flavour his argument isthat the relevant action of the brain is not only computable butrealisable as a totally finite machine i e as a turing machine thatdoes not use any at all in his account the fullrange of computable functions defined in terms of turing machines thatuse an infinite tape only appears as being of specialtheoretical interest uncomputable functions there is afortiori no mention turing uses the finiteness of the nervoussystem to give an estimate of about 10 9 bitsof storage required for a limited simulation of intelligence p the wit and drama of turing s imitation hasattracted more fame than his careful groundwork turing s argument wasdesigned to bypass discussions of the nature of thought mind andconsciousness and to give a criterion in terms of external observationalone his justification for this was that one only judges that otherhuman beings are thinking by external observation and he applied aprinciple of fair play for to argue that thesame should hold for machine intelligence he dramatised this viewpointby a thought experiment nowadays can readily be tried ahuman being and a programmed computer compete to convince an impartialjudge using textual messages alone as to which is the human being if the computer wins it must be credited with intelligence turing introduced his confusingly with a pooranalogy a party game in which a man pretends to be a woman his loosewording p has led some writers wrongly to supposethat turing proposed an imitation in which a machinehas to imitate a man imitating a woman others like place much weight on this game of gender pretence and its realor imaginary connotations in fact the whole point of setting with its remote text message link was to separate intelligence from other human faculties andproperties but it may fairly be said that this confusion reflectsturing s richly ambitious concept of what is involved in it might also be said to illustrate his ownhuman intelligence in particular a delight in the wildean reversal ofroles perhaps reflecting as in wilde his homosexual identity hisfriends knew an alan turing in whom intelligence humour and sex wereoften intermingled turing was in fact sensitive to the difficulty of from other aspects of human senses andactions he described ideas for robots with sensory attachments andraised questions as to whether they might enjoy strawberries and creamor feel racial kinship in contrast he paid scant attention to thequestions of authenticity and deception implicit in his test essentially because he wished to by pass questions about the reality ofconsciousness a subtle aspect of one of his conversations p is wherethe computer imitates human intelligence by giving the wronganswer to a simple arithmetic problem but in turing s setting weare not supposed to ask whether the computer deceives by giving the impression of innumerate humanity nor why itshould wish to do so there is a certain lack of seriousness in thisapproach turing took on a second rank target in countering thepublished views of the brain surgeon g jefferson as regards theobjectivity of consciousness wittgenstein s views on mind would havemade a more serious point of departure turing s imitation principle perhaps also assumes intelligence of that too much of a sharedlanguage and culture for his imagined interrogations neither does itaddress the possibility that there may be kinds of thought by animalsor extra terrestrial intelligences which are not amenable tocommunication a more positive feature of the paper lies in its constructiveprogram for research culminating in turing s ideas for and educating machines p it is generally thought g in dreyfus and that there was always an antagonism between programming and approach of neural networks but turingnever expressed such a dichotomy writing that both approaches shouldbe tried donald michie the british ai research pioneer profoundlyinfluenced by early discussions with turing has called this alan turing s buried in an allusion to abizarre wartime episode in which michie was himself involved p the question is still highly pertinent it is also a commonly expressed view that artificial intelligenceideas only occurred to pioneers in the after the successof computers in large arithmetical calculations it is hard to see whyturing s work which was rooted from the outset in the question ofmechanising mind has been so much overlooked but through his failureto publish and promote work such as that in he largelylost recognition and influence it is also curious that turing s best known paper should appear in ajournal of philosophy for it may well be said that turing alwayscommitted to materialist explanation was not really a philosopher atall turing was a mathematician and what he had to offer philosophylay in illuminating its field with what had been discovered inmathematics and physics in the 1950 paper this was surprisinglycursory apart from his groundwork on the concept of computability hisemphasis on the sufficiency of the computable to explain the action ofthe mind was stated more as a hypothesis even a manifesto than arguedin detail of his hypothesis he wrote p i believe that at the end of the century the use ofwords and general educated opinion will have altered so much that onewill be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to becontradicted i believe further that no useful purpose is served byconcealing these beliefs the popular view that scientists proceedinexorably from established fact to established fact never beinginfluenced by any unproved conjecture is quite mistaken provided itis made clear which are proved facts and which are conjecture no harmcan result conjectures are of great importance since they suggestuseful lines of research penrose p probing into turing s conjecture haspresented it as turing s thus it seems likely that he viewed physical action in which would include the action of a human brain to bealways reducible to some kind of turing machine action the statement that all physical action is in effect computable goesbeyond turing s explicit words but is a fair characterisation of theimplicit assumptions behind the 1950 paper turing s consideration the argument from continuity in the nervous system inparticular simply asserts that the physical system of the brain can beapproximated as closely as is desired by a computer program p certainly there is nothing in turing s work in 50 period to contradict penrose s interpretation the moretechnical precursor papers 1947 include wide rangingcomments on physical processes but make no reference to thepossibility of physical effects being uncomputable in particular a section of is devoted to a generalclassification of machines the period between 1937 had given turing much more experience of actual machinery than hehad in 1936 and his post war remarks reflected this in a down to earthmanner turing distinguished machinery the latter being illustrated a naturally it is the former in modernterms information based with whichturing s analysis is concerned it is noteworthy that in 1948 as despite his knowledge of physics turing made no mention of howquantum mechanics might affect the concept his concept of remained entirely within the classical framework of the turing he called a logical computing machine in this paper the same section of also drew the distinction between discrete and continuous machinery illustrating thelatter with the as a continuous controllingmachine he made light of the difficulty of reducing continuous physicsto the discrete model of the turing machine and though the as a continuous machine stated that it couldprobably be treated as if discrete he gave no indication that physicalcontinuity threatened the paramount role of computability in fact histhrust in was to promote the digital computer as morepowerful than analog machines such as the differential analyser when he discussed this comparison he gave the following informalversion of the church turing thesis one of my conclusions was that the idea of a rule process and a machine weresynonymous the expression machine of coursemeans one which could be carried out by the type of machine i wasconsidering e turing turing gave no hint that the discreteness of the turing machineconstituted a real limitation or that the non discrete processes ofanalog machines might be of any deep significance turing also introduced the idea of random buthis examples the digits of showed that he considered pseudo random sequences e computable sequences withsuitable quite adequate for hisdiscussion he made no suggestion that randomness implied somethinguncomputable and indeed gave no definition of the this is perhaps surprising in view of the factthat his work in pure mathematics logic and cryptography all gave himconsiderable motivation to approach this question at a seriouslevel 8 unfinished work from 1950 turing worked on a new mathematical theory of morphogenesis based on showing the consequences of non linear equations for chemicalreaction and diffusion he was a pioneer in using acomputer for such work some writers have referred to this theory asfounding artificial life but this is a misleadingdescription apt only to the extent that the theory was intended asturing saw it to counter the argument from design a life since has concerned itself with using computers to explore the logicalconsequences of evolutionary theory without worrying about specificphysiological forms morphogenesis is complementary being concerned toshow which physiological pathways are feasible for evolution toexploit turing s work was developed by others in the and is nowregarded as central to this field it may well be that turing s interest in morphogenesis went back toa primordial childhood wonder at the appearance of plants and flowers but in another late development turing went back to other stimuli ofhis youth for in 1951 turing did consider the problem hithertoavoided of setting computability in the context of quantum mechanicalphysics in a bbc radio talk of that year he discussedthe basic groundwork of his 1950 paper but this time dealing ratherless certainly with the argument from del s theorem and thistime also referring to the quantum mechanical physics underlying thebrain turing described the universal machine property applying it tothe brain but said that its applicability required that the machinewhose behaviour is to be imitated should be of the sort whose behaviour is inprinciple predictable by calculation we certainly do not know how anysuch calculation should be done and it was even argued by sir arthureddington that on account of the indeterminacy principle in quantummechanics no such prediction is even theoreticallypossible copeland has rightly drawn attention to this sentence in hispreface to his edition of the 1951 talk however copeland s criticalcontext suggests some connection with turing s oracle there is is in fact no mention of oracles here anywhere inturing s post war discussion of mind and machine turing here isdiscussing the possibility that when seen as as a quantum mechanical machine rather than a classical machine the turing machine model is inadequate the correct connection to drawis not with turing s 1938 work on ordinal logics but with hisknowledge of quantum mechanics from eddington and von neumann in hisyouth indeed in an early speculation influenced by eddington turinghad suggested that quantum mechanical physics could yield the basis offree will 1983 p von neumann s axioms of quantummechanics involve two processes unitary evolution of the wavefunction which is predictable and the measurement or reductionoperation which introduces unpredictability turing s reference tounpredictability must therefore refer to the reduction process theessential difficulty is that still to this day there is no agreed orcompelling theory of when or how reduction actually occurs shouldbe noted that quantum computing in the standard modernsense is based on the predictability of the unitary evolution anddoes not as yet go into the question of how reduction occurs itseems that this single sentence indicates the beginning of a new fieldof investigation for turing this time into the foundations of quantummechanics in 1953 turing wrote to his friend and student robin gandythat he was trying to invent a new quantum mechanics but itwon t really work at turing s death in june 1954 gandy reported in a letter to newmanon what he knew of turing s current work he wrote ofturing having discussed a problem in understanding the reductionprocess in the form of the turing it is easy toshow using standard theory that if a system start in an eigenstate ofsome observable and measurements are made of that observable n times asecond then even if the state is not a stationary one theprobability that the system will be in the same state after say tends to one as n tends to infinity i e that continualobservation will prevent motion alan and i tackled one or twotheoretical physicists with this and they rather pooh poohed it bysaying that continual observation is not possible but there is nothingin the standard books g dirac to this effect so that at least theparadox shows up an inadequacy of quantum theory as usuallypresented turing s investigations take on added significance in view of theassertion of penrose 1990 1994 that the reductionprocess must involve something uncomputable probably turing was aimingat the opposite idea of finding a theory of the reduction process thatwould be predictive and computable and so plug the gap in hishypothesis that the action of the brain is computable however turingand penrose are alike in seeing this as an important question affectingthe assumption that all mental action is computable in this they bothdiffer from the mainstream view in which the question is accordedlittle significance alan turing s last postcards to robin gandy in march 1954 messages from the unseen in allusion to eddington hinted at new ideas in the fundamental physics of relativity andparticle physics 1983 p they illustrate the wealth ofideas with which he was concerned at that last point in his life butwhich apart from these hints are entirely lost a review of such lostideas is given in as part of a larger volume onturing s legacy 9 alan turing the unknown mind it is a pity that turing did not write more about his ethicalphilosophy and world outlook as a student he was an admirer of bernardshaw s plays of ideas and to friends would openly voice both thehilarities and frustrations of his many difficult situations yet thenearest he came to serious personal writing apart from occasionalcomments in private letters was in penning a short story about crisis 1983 p his last two years were particularlyfull of shavian drama and wildean irony in one letter his friendnorman routledge the letter is now in the turing archive at king scollege he wrote turing believes machines think turing lies with men therefore machines do not think the syllogistic allusion to socrates is unmistakeable and hisdemise with cyanide rather than hemlock may have signalled somethingsimilar a parallel figure in world war ii robert oppenheimer suffered the loss of his reputation during the same week that turingdied both combined the purest scientific work and the most effectiveapplication of science in war alan turing was even more directly onthe receiving end of science when his sexual mind was treated as amachine against his protesting consciousness and will but amidst allthis human drama he left little to say about what he really thought ofhimself and his relationship to the world of human events alan turing did not fit easily with any of the intellectualmovements of his time aesthetic technocratic or marxist in commentators struggled to find discreet words to categorise him as a scientific shelley as possessing great but until the the reality of his life wasunmentionable he is still hard to place within twentieth centurythought he exalted the science that existentialists held to have hadrobbed life of meaning the most original
