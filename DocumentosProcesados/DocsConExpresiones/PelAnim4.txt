animation i personally prefer the lion king it has been my all time favorite for as long as i can remember the idea of this film arose during production on oliver and company at first called king of the jungle it was meant to be a documentary animated styled film with no dialog that idea changed when they found out that lions don t live in forests and a lot of people thought that the lion king was going to be bad so most of the animators left to go work on disney s next project pocahontas as they thought it would have been more successful the animators that stayed were amateurs but they loved animals it was an opportunity for them to show what they could do as time went on the film developed into what it is today people were astonished by how successful it became the lion king ended up being a way better film then pocahontas the film broke many records at the box office as it starred a lot of big named stars like jeremy irons nathan lane james earl jones whoopi goldberg cheech marin madge sinclair rowan atkinson moira kelly and matthew broderick the music by hans zimmer tim rice and elton john was the best anybody heard it was re released in 2011 and has a rounded total of well over 900 million shattering batb s record and became the highest grossing hand drawn film ever and still is today it is the highest animation behind toy story 3 minions and frozen the lion king is the highest grossing film of all time 35 pocahontas g 81 min animation adventure drama 6 7 0 rate 1 rate 2 rate 3 rate 4 rate 5 rate 6 rate 7 rate 8 rate 9 rate 10 rate 0 error please try again 58
