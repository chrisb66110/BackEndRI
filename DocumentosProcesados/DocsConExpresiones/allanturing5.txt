mathison turing was one of the great pioneers of the computerfield he inspired the now common terms of the turing and turing s test as a mathematician he appliedthe concept of the algorithm to digital computers his researchinto the relationships between machines and nature created thefield of artificial intelligence his intelligence and foresightmade him one of the first to step into the information age alan turing was born in london on june 23 1912 as soon ashe began attending school his aptitude for the sciences beganto emerge when it came to the more right brain topics of englishand history however his attention waned his instructors attemptedto get alan to study other disciplines but he would respond tomathematics and science he retained this trait throughout hiseducation he began his career in mathematics at king s college cambridgeuniversity in 1931 it was here that his tendencies to recreateprevious discoveries began to emerge turing seemed to have littleinterest in using the work of previous scientists he would typicallyspend time recreating their work instead upon graduation turingwas made a fellow of king s college and then moved on to princetonuniversity it was during this time that he explored what waslater called the turing machine turing helped pioneer the concept of the digital computer theturing machine that he envisioned is essentially the same as today smulti purpose computers he described a machine that would reada series of ones and zeros from a tape these ones and zerosdescribed the steps that needed to be done to solve a particularproblem or perform a certain task the turing machine would readeach of the steps and perform them in sequence resulting in theproper answer this concept was revolutionary for the time most computersin the 1950 s were designed for a particular purpose or a limitedrange of purposes what turing envisioned was a machine thatcould do anything something that we take for granted today the method of instructing the computer was very important in turing sconcept he essentially described a machine which knew a fewsimple instructions making the computer perform a particulartask was simply a matter of breaking the job down into a seriesof these simple instructions this is identical to the processprogrammers go through today he believed that an algorithm couldbe developed for most any problem the hard part was determiningwhat the simple steps were and how to break down the larger problems during world war ii turing used his knowledge and ideas in thedepartment of communications in great britain there he usedhis mathematical skills to decipher the codes the germans wereusing to communicate this was an especially difficult task becausethe germans had developed a type of computer called the enigma it was able to generate a constantly changing code that was impossiblefor the code breakers to decipher in a timely fashion the enigma during his time with the department of communications in greatbritain turing and his fellow scientists worked with a devicecalled colossus the colossus quickly and efficiently decipheredthe german codes created by the enigma colossus was essentiallya bunch of servomotors and metal but it was one of the firststeps toward the digital computer after world war ii turing found he needed a way to relieve thestress he had been experiencing and took up long distance running much like everything else he enjoyed he discovered he was quitegood at it he obtained record times in both the 3 and 10 mileraces in the walton athletic club typical of his logical nature his sometimes used his athletic ability to run between locationsfor his lectures turing went on to work for the national physical laboratory continued his research into digital computers here he workedon developing the automatic computing engine one of thefirst attempts at creating a true digital computer it was duringthis time that he began to explore the relationship between computersand nature he wrote a paper called intelligent which was later published in 1969 this was one of the firsttimes the concept of artificial intelligence was raised turing believed that machines could be created that would mimicthe processes of the human brain he discussed the possibilityof such machines acknowledging the difficulty people would haveaccepting a machine that would rival their own intelligence aproblem that still plagues artificial intelligence today inhis mind there was nothing the brain could do that a well designedcomputer could not as part of his argument turing describeddevices already in existence that worked like parts of the humanbody such as television cameras and microphones turing often got into heated debates with other scientists regardinghis radical views of the future of computing from our pointof view the ideas he had are logical and are anything but surprising from the point of view of his peers at the time his ideas wereoutlandish an interesting rebuttal turing would use during sucha debate was to ask his colleague if they could create an examinationthat a computer could not be trained to answer a computer wouldhave no problem with a multiple choice exam however an essaytest would seem to be out of the range of a computer howeverthis just further indicates turing s accurate predictions thereis software available today that allows computers to write essaysgiven only a few guidelines and keywords turing believed that an intelligent machine could be createdby following the blueprints of the human brain he wrote a paperin 1950 describing what is now known as the turing test the test consisted of a person asking questions via keyboardto both a person and an intelligent machine he believed thatif the person could not tell the machine apart from the personafter a reasonable amount of time the machine was somewhat intelligent this test has become the holy grail of the artificial intelligencecommunity turing s paper describing the test has been used incountless journals and papers relating to machine intelligence the 1987 edition of the oxford companion to the mind describesthe turing test as the best test we have for confirmingthe presence of intelligence in a machine p even more recently the computer museum of boston hosted theloebner prize competition in november 1991 the software developerswere tasked with developing a program that could pass a scaleddown version of the turing test modified in that the machineswere only required to converse on a limited topic the only problemwith the value of this test lies in the semantics of artificialintelligence one has to distinguish between software that isprogrammed to appear intelligent versus one that actually hasintelligence determining where one begins and ends is a problembest left to philosophers turing left the national physical laboratory before the completionof the automatic computing engine and moved on to the universityof manchester there he worked on the development of the manchesterautomatic digital machine he truly believed that machineswould be created by the year 2000 that could replicate the humanmind turing worked toward this end by creating algorithms andprograms for the madam he worked to create the operating manualfor the madam and became one of the main users of madam to furtherhis research one major aspect of turing s life that often goes unnoticed ishis work in biology turing only published one paper entitled the chemical basis of morphogenesis in 1952 he had writtena number of other papers but none were finished before his death these have since been published in draft form turing s mainfocus in biology was the physical structure of living things he was interested in how and why organisms developed particularshapes there are millions of cells in a person or a tree andyet all know what shape to be turing wanted to figure out why an important foundation of his research was the argument fromdesign the basic idea behind this first came aroundwhen people still believed that there was an all powerful beingthat had sculpted every living thing how else could all theseorganisms have gotten their various physical traits that allowthem to exist in their particular environment the theory ofgod s intervention was replaced by darwin s idea of natural selectionbefore turing became involved but the concept still works thestructure is being determined by outside intervention turing did not subscribe to this theory he was influenced greatlyby the biologist d arcy thompson who believed that biologicalform was simply a result of chemical and physical processes the selection of the structure does not come into play until thepossible forms have been determined the basic bottom line forturing s position was instead of asking why a certain arrangementof leaves is especially advantageous to a plant he tried to showthat it was a natural consequence of the process by which theleaves are produced he was using a very precise mathematical approach to the problem this gives some insight into his strong belief in the close relationbetween nature and math turing s ultimate goal was to mergealready established biological theory with mathematics and computersto create his intelligent multi purpose machine he saw thedevelopment of these leaves as nothing more than a simple setof steps an algorithm this matched the basic concept of his turing machine turing died on june 7 1954 from what the medical examiners describedas self administered potassium cyanide while in a momentof mental imbalance other reasons for his death have surfaced his mother claimed that he used to experiment with householdchemicals trying to create new substances and became careless others claim he was homosexual and killed himself to preventembarrassment whatever the reason for his death turing was truly one of thegreat forerunners in the field of computers today s computerscientists still refer to his papers the concept of the algorithmlies at the heart of every computer program for any type of digitalcomputer it is very conceivable that his idea of thinking machinesby the year 2000 is not too far from the truth bibliography cortada james w historical dictionary of data processing greenwood press 1987 new york pp 249 253 crockett larry j
