turing was one of the great pioneers of the computer field he inspired the now common terms of the turing and turing s test as a mathematician he applied the concept of the algorithm to digital computers his research into the relationships between machines and nature created the field of artificial intelligence his intelligence and foresight made him one of the first to step into the information age alan turing was born in london on june 23 1912 as soon as he began attending school his aptitude for the sciences began to emerge when it came to the more right brain topics of english and history however his attention waned his instructors attempted to get alan to study other disciplines but he would respond to mathematics and science he retained this trait throughout his education he began his career in mathematics at king s college cambridge university in 1931 it was here that his tendencies to recreate previous discoveries began to emerge turing seemed to have little interest in using the work of previous scientists he would typically spend time recreating their work instead upon graduation turing was made a fellow of king s college and then moved on to princeton university it was during this time that he explored what was later called the turing machine turing helped pioneer the concept of the digital computer the turing machine that he envisioned is essentially the same as today s multi purpose computers he described a machine that would read a series of ones and zeros from a tape these ones and zeros described the steps that needed to be done to solve a particular problem or perform a certain task the turing machine would read each of the steps and perform them in sequence resulting in the proper answer this concept was revolutionary for the time most computers in the 1950 s were designed for a particular purpose or a limited range of purposes what turing envisioned was a machine that could do anything something that we take for granted today the method of instructing the computer was very important in turing s concept he essentially described a machine which knew a few simple instructions making the computer perform a particular task was simply a matter of breaking the job down into a series of these simple instructions this is identical to the process programmers go through today he believed that an algorithm could be developed for most any problem the hard part was determining what the simple steps were and how to break down the larger problems during world war ii turing used his knowledge and ideas in the department of communications in great britain there he used his mathematical skills to decipher the codes the germans were using to communicate this was an especially difficult task because the germans had developed a type of computer called the enigma it was able to generate a constantly changing code that was impossible for the code breakers to decipher in a timely fashion the enigma during his time with the department of communications in great britain turing and his fellow scientists worked with a device called colossus the colossus quickly and efficiently deciphered the german codes created by the enigma colossus was essentially a bunch of servomotors and metal but it was one of the first steps toward the digital computer after world war ii turing found he needed a way to relieve the stress he had been experiencing and took up long distance running much like everything else he enjoyed he discovered he was quite good at it he obtained record times in both the 3 and 10 mile races in the walton athletic club typical of his logical nature his sometimes used his athletic ability to run between locations for his lectures turing went on to work for the national physical laboratory and continued his research into digital computers here he worked on developing the automatic computing engine one of the first attempts at creating a true digital computer it was during this time that he began to explore the relationship between computers and nature he wrote a paper called intelligent which was later published in 1969 this was one of the first times the concept of artificial intelligence was raised turing believed that machines could be created that would mimic the processes of the human brain he discussed the possibility of such machines acknowledging the difficulty people would have accepting a machine that would rival their own intelligence a problem that still plagues artificial intelligence today in his mind there was nothing the brain could do that a well designed computer could not as part of his argument turing described devices already in existence that worked like parts of the human body such as television cameras and microphones turing often got into heated debates with other scientists regarding his radical views of the future of computing from our point of view the ideas he had are logical and are anything but surprising from the point of view of his peers at the time his ideas were outlandish an interesting rebuttal turing would use during such a debate was to ask his colleague if they could create an examination that a computer could not be trained to answer a computer would have no problem with a multiple choice exam however an essay test would seem to be out of the range of a computer however this just further indicates turing s accurate predictions there is software available today that allows computers to write essays given only a few guidelines and keywords turing believed that an intelligent machine could be created by following the blueprints of the human brain he wrote a paper in 1950 describing what is now known as the turing test the test consisted of a person asking questions via keyboard to both a person and an intelligent machine he believed that if the person could not tell the machine apart from the person after a reasonable amount of time the machine was somewhat intelligent this test has become the holy grail of the artificial intelligence community turing s paper describing the test has been used in countless journals and papers relating to machine intelligence the 1987 edition of the oxford companion to the mind describes the turing test as the best test we have for confirming the presence of intelligence in a machine p even more recently the computer museum of boston hosted the loebner prize competition in november 1991 the software developers were tasked with developing a program that could pass a scaled down version of the turing test modified in that the machines were only required to converse on a limited topic the only problem with the value of this test lies in the semantics of artificial intelligence one has to distinguish between software that is programmed to appear intelligent versus one that actually has intelligence determining where one begins and ends is a problem best left to philosophers turing left the national physical laboratory before the completion of the automatic computing engine and moved on to the university of manchester there he worked on the development of the manchester automatic digital machine he truly believed that machines would be created by the year 2000 that could replicate the human mind turing worked toward this end by creating algorithms and programs for the madam he worked to create the operating manual for the madam and became one of the main users of madam to further his research one major aspect of turing s life that often goes unnoticed is his work in biology turing only published one paper entitled the chemical basis of morphogenesis in 1952 he had written a number of other papers but none were finished before his death these have since been published in draft form turing s main focus in biology was the physical structure of living things he was interested in how and why organisms developed particular shapes there are millions of cells in a person or a tree and yet all know what shape to be turing wanted to figure out why an important foundation of his research was the argument from design the basic idea behind this first came around when people still believed that there was an all powerful being that had sculpted every living thing how else could all these organisms have gotten their various physical traits that allow them to exist in their particular environment the theory of god s intervention was replaced by darwin s idea of natural selection before turing became involved but the concept still works the structure is being determined by outside intervention turing did not subscribe to this theory he was influenced greatly by the biologist d arcy thompson who believed that biological form was simply a result of chemical and physical processes the selection of the structure does not come into play until the possible forms have been determined the basic bottom line for turing s position was instead of asking why a certain arrangement of leaves is especially advantageous to a plant he tried to show that it was a natural consequence of the process by which the leaves are produced he was using a very precise mathematical approach to the problem this gives some insight into his strong belief in the close relation between nature and math turing s ultimate goal was to merge already established biological theory with mathematics and computers to create his intelligent multi purpose machine he saw the development of these leaves as nothing more than a simple set of steps an algorithm this matched the basic concept of his turing machine turing died on june 7 1954 from what the medical examiners described as self administered potassium cyanide while in a moment of mental imbalance other reasons for his death have surfaced his mother claimed that he used to experiment with household chemicals trying to create new substances and became careless others claim he was homosexual and killed himself to prevent embarrassment whatever the reason for his death turing was truly one of the great forerunners in the field of computers today s computer scientists still refer to his papers the concept of the algorithm lies at the heart of every computer program for any type of digital computer it is very conceivable that his idea of thinking machines by the year 2000 is not too far from the truth bibliography cortada james w
