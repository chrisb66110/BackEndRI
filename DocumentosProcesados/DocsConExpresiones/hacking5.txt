and can safely overcome their of determining which dip they should prepare for which chip however in light of recent copyright law awareness we wish to remind everyone that pursuant to 17 usc 1 110 watching the superbowl on a screen larger than 55 inches and or using more than four speakers in one room for its audio constitutes a public performance and is thereby copyright infringement if not properly licensed not to mention merely having friends over to watch it also is a violation regardless of screen size or speaker count so go enjoy the big game just uhh by yourself on a small screen

freedom is far from over it is quite saddening that on the very same day of the protest the united states supreme cou read more comments 16 01 12 sopa almost dead pipa still alive word is out on the street that us house representative eric cantor has effectively sopa upon further reading though representative cantor has done nothing more than delayed when sopa will reach the house floor until issues are please note sopa is not dead it is merely delayed likely until the firestorm against it dies down and they can somehow else sneak it into action even worse senator harry reid intends to move forward with bringing pipa to the senate floor on january hackthissite still intends on censoring itself on january to continue raising awareness of these two extremely dangerous internet
