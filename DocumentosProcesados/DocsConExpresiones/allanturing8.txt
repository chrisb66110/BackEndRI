and the beginning of ai the earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid century by the british logician and computer pioneer alan mathison turing in 1935 turing described an abstract computing machine consisting of early life and career the son of a civil servant turing was educated at a top private school he entered the university of cambridge to study mathematics in 1931 after graduating in 1934 he was elected to a fellowship at kings college college since in recognition of his research in probability theory in 1936 turings seminal paper on computable numbers with an application to the entscheidungsproblem decision problem was recommended for publication by the american mathematical logician alonzo church who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as turings although by a different method turings method not so much had profound significance for the emerging science of computing later that year turing moved to princeton university to study for a ph d in mathematical logic under churchs direction in the entscheidungsproblem what mathematicians called an effective method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote in turings time those rote workers were in fact called computers and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers the entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not a method for determining this is called a decision method in 1936 turing and church independently showed that in general the entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method in fact turing and church showed that even some purely logical systems considerably weaker than arithmetic have no effective decision method this result and othersnotably mathematician logician kurt gdel s incompleteness resultsdashed the hopes held by some mathematicians of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that computers could carry out it was in the course of his work on the entscheidungsproblem that turing invented the universal turing machine an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer the church turing thesis an important step in turings argument about the entscheidungsproblem was the claim now called the church turing thesis that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal turing machine the claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation church in his work used instead the thesis that all human computable functions are identical to what he called lambda definable functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated turing showed in 1936 that churchs thesis was equivalent to his own by proving that every lambda definable function is computable by the universal turing machine and vice versa in a review of turings work church acknowledged the superiority of turings formulation of the thesis over his own made no reference to computing saying that the concept of computability by a turing machine has the advantage of making the identification with effectivenessevident immediately code breaker having returned from the united states to his fellowship at kings college in the summer of 1938 turing went on to join the government code and cypher school and at the outbreak of war with germany in september 1939 he moved to the organizations wartime headquarters at bletchley park buckinghamshire a few weeks previously the polish government had given britain and france details of the polish successes against enigma the principal cipher machine used by the german military to encrypt radio communications as early as 1932 a small team of polish mathematician cryptanalysts led by marian rejewski had succeeded in deducing the internal wiring of enigma and by 1938 rejewskis team had devised a code breaking machine they called the bomba polish word for a type of ice the bomba depended for its success on german operating procedures and a change in those procedures in may 1940 rendered the bomba useless during the autumn of 1939 and the spring of 1940 turing and others designed a related but very different code breaking machine known as the bombe for the rest of the war bombes supplied the allies with large quantities of military intelligence by early 1942 the cryptanalysts at bletchley park were decoding about 39 000 intercepted messages each month a figure that rose subsequently to more than 84 000 per monthtwo messages every minute day and night in 1942 turing also devised the first systematic method for breaking messages encrypted by the sophisticated german cipher machine that the british called tunny at the end of the war turing was made an officer of the most excellent order of the british empire for his code breaking work computer designer in 1945 the war over turing was recruited to the national physical laboratory in london to create an electronic computer his design for the automatic computing engine was the first complete specification of an electronic stored program all purpose digital computer had turings ace been built as he planned it would have had vastly more memory than any of the other early computers as well as being faster however his colleagues at npl thought the engineering too difficult to attempt and a much smaller machine was built the pilot model ace npl lost the race to build the worlds first working electronic stored program digital computeran honour that went to the royal society computing machine laboratory at the university of manchester in june 1948 discouraged by the delays at npl turing took up the deputy directorship of the computing machine laboratory in that year was no his earlier theoretical concept of a universal turing machine had been a fundamental influence on the manchester computer project from the beginning after turings arrival at manchester his main contributions to the computers development were to design an input output systemusing bletchley park technologyand to design its programming system he also wrote the first ever programming manual and his programming system was used in the ferranti mark i the first marketable electronic digital computer artificial intelligence pioneer turing was a founding father of artificial intelligence and of modern cognitive science and he was a leading early exponent of the hypothesis that the human brain is in large part a digital computing machine he theorized that the cortex at birth is an unorganised machine that through training becomes organized into a universal machine or something like it turing proposed what subsequently became known as the turing test as a criterion for whether an artificial computer is thinking last years turing was elected a fellow of the royal society of london in march 1951 a high honour yet his life was about to become very hard in march 1952 he was convicted of gross indecencythat is to say homosexuality a crime in britain at that timeand he was sentenced to 12 months of hormone therapy now with a criminal record he would never again be able to work for government communications headquarters the british governments postwar code breaking centre turing spent the remainder of his short career at manchester where he was appointed to a specially created readership in the theory of computing in may 1953 from 1951 turing had been working on what is now known as artificial life he published the chemical basis of morphogenesis in 1952 describing aspects of his research on the development of form and pattern in living organisms turing used manchesters ferranti mark i computer to model his hypothesized chemical mechanism for the generation of anatomical structure in animals and plants turing alan morphogenesis learn about alan turing s explanation of morphogenesis open university in the midst of this groundbreaking work turing was discovered dead in his bed poisoned by cyanide the official verdict was suicide but no motive was established at the 1954 inquest his death is often attributed to the hormone treatment he received at the hands of the authorities following his trial for being gay yet he died more than a year after the hormone doses had ended and in any case the resilient turing had borne that cruel treatment with what his close friend peter hilton called amused fortitude also to judge by the records of the inquest no evidence at all was presented to indicate that turing intended to take his own life nor that the balance of his mind was disturbed the coroner in fact his mental state appears to have been unremarkable at the time although suicide cannot be ruled out it is also possible that his death was simply an accident the result of his inhaling cyanide fumes from an experiment in the tiny laboratory adjoining his bedroom nor can murder by the secret services be entirely ruled out given that turing knew so much about cryptanalysis at a time when homosexuals were regarded as threats to national security by the early century turings prosecution for being gay had become infamous in 2009 british prime minister gordon brown speaking on behalf of the british government publicly apologized for turings utterly unfair treatment four years later queen elizabeth ii granted turing a royal pardon b j copeland learn more in
