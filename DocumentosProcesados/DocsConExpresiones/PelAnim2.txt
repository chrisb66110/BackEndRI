simple slice of life story of one womans childhood and her time spent in the countryside as an adult whereas miyazakis films more often skew towards the fantastical takahata has a penchant for directing more human dramas that are distinguished with wildly varying and experimental art styles only yesterday follows taeko okajima a 27 year old unmarried office worker who takes a holiday to visit her extended family in the rural farmlands of yamagata where she helps to harvest safflowers while there she reflects back on her time as a young girl growing up with her parents in tokyo and how her experiences back then have come to shape her life in the present only yesterday was a rarity when it was first released in 1991 an animated drama tailored for adult audiences near entirely absent of the gloss of magical realism that defined the majority of studio ghiblis most of the anime industry work up to that point an endearing story of the power of nostalgia and how it shapes perception of the world and of ourselves well into adulthood only yesterday defied expectations and went on to become the highest grossing japanese film of that year inspiring a wave of similar slice of life features and earning takahata immense critical acclaim only yesterday remains something special nearly twenty five years later an earnest and affecting story of a woman continuing to grow and learn well past becoming an adult 24 nausica of the valley of the wind director hayao miyazaki nausica of the valley of the wind is quite simply the film responsible for the creation of studio ghibli the film not only signaled miyazakis nascent status as one of animes preeminent creators but also sparked the creation of an animation studio whose creative output would dominate the medium for decades to come following the release of the castle of cagliostro miyazaki was commissioned by his producer and future long time collaborator toshio suzuki to create a manga in order to better pitch a potential film to his employers at animage what resulted was nausica a fantasy epic inspired by the works of ursula k le guin and jean moebius giraud starring a courageous warrior princess trying to mend a rift between humans and the forces of nature while soaring across a post apocalyptic world the success of nausica as a serialized manga would culminate in a film adaptation that would then go on to be heralded as one of the greatest animated films of all time nausica was the film that introduced the world to motifs and themes by which miyazaki would become universally known for a courageous female protagonist unconscious of and undeterred by gender norms the surmounting power of compassion environmental advocacy and an unwavering love and fascination with the phenomenon of flight the essentialness of nausica of the valley of the wind s placement within the greater canon of animated film japanese or otherwise cannot be overstated it spawned an entire generation of animators among them hideaki anno whose lauded work on the films climactic finale would later inspire him to go on to create neon genesis evangelion if you havent seen this film yet do so immediately and if you have already it only gets better with age 23 memories director various after wrapping production on akira in 1988 katsuhiro otomo returned in 1995 to helm his third anthology collection of short films titled memories initially scripted around the theme of the collections namesake the anthology eventually yielded a series of three shorts each directed by one of three of the most acclaimed directors working at the time otomo included the collections first segment magnetic rose is unanimously praised as the anthologys best and for good reason directed by koji morimoto and scripted by satoshi kon magnetic rose is emblematic of the themes of perception identity and uncertainty which exemplify kons work at its best depicting the terrifying story of a deep space salvage cruises ensnarement in the siren wiles of an aristocratic opera singer the anthologys other two installments tensai okamuras stink bomb and otomos cannon fodder are worth the price of admission as well the former a crassly comedic take on an extinction level crisis and the latter a wartime parable animated with a intriguing terry gilliam esque art style in one long take whatever your palate as anime film goer memories is not to be missed 22 ninja scroll director yoshiaki kawajira set during the tokugawa era of japan ninja scroll follows the story of jubei kibagami an itinerant samurai warrior inspired by the real life folk hero jubei who is recruited by a government agent to defeat the eight devils of kimon a cabal of demonic ninja who conspire to overthrow the tokugawa regime and plunge japan into destruction along the way he meets kagero a beautiful and mysterious poison eater and is forced to confront the demons of his past as he fights to preserve the present produced during the boom of animes foreign markets ninja scroll was one of the first titles released by manga entertainment in the west its well defined animation unflinching hyper violence and impressively creative fight sequences made it a requisite gateway title for early anime fans and is rightfully looked upon as a cult classic to this day the film qualifies as a time capsule for one of animes heyday periods with exquisite production values married to impeccably crafted set pieces ninja scroll pushed the boundaries of excess with unflinching depictions of sensuality and sexual violence shown alongside showers of gore and decapitation the film was front and center for the argument that anime wasnt just for kids in the mid and qualifies today as a must see title for a serious anime fan yoshiaki kawajiris ninja scroll is the quintessential anime chanbara action film no question 21 panda and the magic serpent director taiji yabushita kazuhiko okabe based on the chinese folktale the legend of the white snake panda and the magic serpent is noteworthy for being not only being the first full color anime film but for being the first licensed anime film to be shown in america in 1952 shortly after the post war animosities between japan and the west began to dissipate toei studio acquired the rights to the story and five years later set out to adapt it into a feature length film hiroshi okawa president of toei films at the time had hoped to emulate the personality driven marketing of walt disney with the film aiming to transform the studio into the so called disney of the east despite receiving honors at the venice childrens film festival in 1959 the film performed poorly in the states and received a very small theater run the films significance doesnt stop there though as panda and the magic serpent is credited by hayao miyazaki as one of the films that first inspired him to become an animator and rintaro who would later become an influential director in his own right for such films as galaxy express 999 and metropolis got his first animation job as an in betweener working on this very film 20 mind game director masaaki yuasa trying to pin down masaaki yuasas 2004 breakout debut with a summary is no easy task as the now storied director behind such modern anime classics as kick heart ping pong and the tatami galaxy revels in defying expectations with his maximalist anything goes approach to animation when 20 year old aspiring comic artist nishi dies in a yakuza hold up while attempting to protect his childhood crush myon his soul meets god before escaping limbo and reassuming his body moments before his tragic death the couple lead a high speed getaway in one of the yakuza members cars before diving into the ocean and being swallowed into the belly of a see what i mean mind game is like witnessing a seven hour ayahuasca trip encapsulated into a feature length film impressionistic avant garde and above all unique mind game is a confusing and exhilarating shock to the senses thats just shy of impossible to forget 19 redline director takeshi koike without question takeshi koike is one of the greatest animators alive and working today problem is youve probably never heard of him not surprising considering his most critically recognized work was not produced until well into his late thirties recruited by studio madhouse straight out of high school in 1986 koike became something of a protg to veteran director yoshiaki kawajiri and cut his teeth as an inbetween animator for such films as cyber city oedo 808 and ninja scroll before striking out on his own projects during the after directing projects such as trava fist planet the animatrix short world record and the pilot for afro samurai koike poured the sum total of his talents into creating what is now popularly considered his opus redline a stylistically bold high octane racing adventure nearly seven years in the making koikes style is unmistakable with exaggerated silhouettes framed by jagged shadows extreme focal points and unrelenting action that recalls the works of mike mignola frank miller and peter chung redline is a feast for the senses a no holds barred visual spectacle with every framed packed with innocuous intricacies rendered in meticulous loving detail the story is threadbare no doubt but as a film that triumphantly pays off its protracted gestation period with a product thats this unabashedly impressive and downright cool redline squarely fits into the select number of anime films that one just has to see before they die 18 belladonna of sadness director eiichi yamamoto inspired by jules michelets book satanism and witchcraft the third and final film in osamu tezukas animerama trilogy was so expensive and avant garde its failure bankrupted its production company mushi pro the only film in the trilogy not directed by tezuka left the project in its conceptual eiichi yamamotos belladonna of sadness is amongst the most unusual animated films ever put to celluloid this is not a huge surprise from a talent as legendary as yamamoto among whose mighty credits are titles like kimba the white lion and space battleship yamato belladonna of sadness is the tale of a village woman named jeanne who is raped by her liege lord and his men on her wedding night and makes a literal deal with the devil to gain magical powers and lead a rebellion against the evil lord belladonna is extreme in every sense of the word start with the lookthe film consists almost entirely of pans across still watercolor paintings with occasional expressive burst of color and movement scattered throughout the designs owe virtually nothing to traditional anime character construction or even tezukas own more cartoonish style instead the look of the film owes a great debt to european painters like gustav klimt degas and kandinsky among others filled with haunting music lots of disembodied voice over and vibrantly rendered yet horrifying scenes of rape nudity murder and madness its no surprise belladonna of sadness was banned in many countries for decades the feminist subtext of the film is very much foregroundedclearly jeanne is an avatar for jeanne darc of and there are also direct links in one scene between jeanne and marianne the female personification of the french republic despite the darkness jeanne wallows in and the horrors she is subjected to this is a film worth experiencing mostly because there has really nothing been like it either before or since in the history of anime make sure you are ready for some near pornographic sexuality and disturbing scenes of violation the tale is brutal but the beauty in which its told means we cant look away j d 17 millennium actress director satoshi kon satoshi kons second film millennium actress builds off the themes of cinema and celebrity previously explored in his debut perfect blue but instead this time casting them in the mold of a metafictional fairytale quest for love inspired by the lives of setsuko hara and hideko takamine two of japans premiere early century stars millennium actress follows the story of chiyoko fujiwara a reclusive septuagenarian who recounts the story behind her illustrious career as a film actress when approached by a pair of interviewers eager to film a documentary one of kons signature motifs as a director was the mutability of reality and fantasy constantly dovetailing into one another to create works that speak to the multiplicity of the human experience millennium actress is a prime example of this with the films presentation constantly assaulting the fourth wall blending factual events and cinematic flair until the two are inseparable from one another unlike most of his contemporaries kon was not satisfied to look only toward the insular vacuum of genre anime for inspiration but instead looked to such works as george roy hills 1972 adaptation of slaughterhouse five a film whose use of scene cuts and transitions play a huge role in distinguishing millennium actress among other films of its time combining references to the physical comedy of buster keaton akira kurosawa s throne of blood and hiroshi inagakis rickshaw man millennium actress is a testament to kons enduring love of cinema that deserves to be seen examined and cherished for years to come 16 super dimension fortress macross do you remember love director shoji kawamori noboru ishiguro shoji kawamoris macross known in the united states as robotech has a convoluted history both in its country of origin and here in the states the first macross movie macross do you remember love further complicated the macross legacy the film is essentially a reimagining of the the popular tv series macross like the show the film centers around the crew of a giant space fortress macross as they attempt to evade an alien race the zentradi and discover that the key to their victory just might be the effect that earth made pop music has on their enemy yes you read that right the films other focus is the love triangle between dashing pilot hikaru ichijyo pop idol lynn minmay and lieutenant misa hayase although the cast of characters and voice actors are the same as those that appear in the tv series and the plot covers much of the same ground within the canon of the macross universe do you remember love is actually a popular fictionalized retelling of the true events that occurred in the series regardless macross do you remember love nails everything great about the showgorgeous mecha designs excellent dramatic a little over the storytelling and an alternatively infuriating and captivating love triangleand does so in a little over two hours if youre looking to understand the appeal of macross this is the place to start in many ways it is typical of its time in terms of character design themes and the plot device of a band of humans on the run from an alien menace yet it is an incredibly well designed directed and animated film that retains its sense of adventure even in the context of the somber overall plot a massive hit in japan it has never had an uncut official release in the united states due to legal squabbles between harmony gold the american rights holder for macross and various japanese production entities the original film was a huge hit in japan with lines stretching around the block on the weekend of its premiere and is now considered a classic its hard to track down for u s fans but well worth the effort for anyone looking for a good space opera and pop music good enough to defeat an alien race j d 15 metropolis director rintaro not to be confused with fritz langs landmark 1927 sci fi film of the same name metropolis is instead a loose adaptation inspired by osamu tezukas 1949 manga which itself was inspired in part by langs aforementioned opus written by katsuhiro otomo and directed by rintaro the films aesthetic and themes share more than a passing resemblance to otomos genre defining akira set in the titular multi layered megacity amid social upheaval between the human bourgeoisie and the robotic working class metropolis follows the story of private detective shunsaku ban and his nephew kenichi who while visiting metropolis on their mission to apprehend the nefarious dr laughton happen upon a mysterious robotic girl named tima whose existence may in fact hold the key to either the citys salvation or destruction much like akira metropolis is a sprawling epic of intersecting storylines sweeping set pieces and monolithic settings packed with a dense array of intricate details and beautiful color palettes decidedly darker than tezukas manga the film is neither an adaptation of either that or langs film but rather an attempt to expand upon the inspiration of the two a high flying sci fi adventure that doubles as social commentary for the shared struggle and seemingly inevitable antagonism between factions of the lower working class and humankinds hubristic quest for power and control of a world that dwarfs their ambitions metropolis may not have struck big at the box officeonly earning million towards its million budgetand it may not resonate with the same cult classic recognition as films like ghost in the shell or ninja scroll but it remains an immense achievement by two of the greatest anime directors alive who sought to both honor and surpass the work of one of the most influential anime pioneers of all time 14 barefoot gen director mori masaki there is perhaps no more catastrophically significant event in modern japanese history than that of the nuclear bombardment of hiroshima and nagasaki during world war ii keiji nakazawas 1973 semi autobiographical manga barefoot gen is a testament to this event depicting one young boys struggle to survive in the wake of witnessing his friends and family gruesomely disintegrated by the indiscriminate force of a nuclear impact mori masakis adaptation takes nakazawas original and brings it to life on screen delivering a harrowing snapshot of one of historys most horrific instances of mass annihilation the fateful scene where the enola gay detonates the bomb over hiroshima is breathtaking and heart wrenching as six year old gens home is pummeled in a shockwave of devastating power before subsiding into a plume of atomic hellfire but to reduce barefoot gen s significance to that of only being destruction porn created to induce guilt would be disingenuous the film is all in all a human story of resilience and stubborn hope in the face of annihilation and hopefully can be looked back upon as a sobering reminder of the costs of unremitting warfare and what we all still have to lose if we were to forget the lessons of the past 13 pom poko director isao takahata pom poko is the type of film that feels inconvertible from its cultural origin forget trying to make this one more palatable for western sensibilities pom poko doubles down on the qualities that identify it as japanese film and brandishes them proudly for all to see although better known for his realistic human dramas rendered through increasingly more experimental animation techniques pom poko is isao takahatas first foray into full on fantasy farce depicting the story of a clan of japanese raccoon dogs as tanuki whose home is ravaged by urban development emboldened both to defend their home and possibly learn to peacefully coexist alongside the humans the tanuki retrain themselves in their lost ancestral ability of transformation to disguise themselves in modern society but what distinguishes pom poko as such a unique cultural curiosity the answer is simple balls or to be more descriptive the on screen prominence of the tanukis testicles as they use them in increasingly more inventive ways to disguise or defend themselves though surprisingly non explicit and unquestionably coded as a childrens comedy film this aspect might turn off potential audiences from exploring it and perhaps explains why the movie is relatively so unknown even among ardent of studio ghibli fans still pom poko is a brilliant slapstick take on traditional japanese mythologysomething of a cross between watership down meets the gods must be crazy thats full of zany and inventive animation and genuine emotional depth if youve always yearned in your heart of hearts for a studio ghibli film where a pack of anthropomorphic raccoons use their gigantic testicles as bludgeoning weapons in a last stand against police officers rest assured because your prayers have been answered 12 princess mononoke director hayao miyazaki one persistent theme across all of studio ghiblis work in particular miyazakis is that there rarely are any true villains this sentiment is perhaps most apparent in princess mononoke miyazakis seventh film and notably one of his darkest set during the early century the film follows the story of ashitaka the last remaining prince of a small eastern village who is wounded while defending his home from a wild boar overtaken by a malicious spirit mortally cursed with no hope of a cure ashitaka takes it upon himself to journey to the west and discover and halt whatever malevolent force is causing this havoc what he finds there is more complicated than he could have imagined a settlement of humans mining the region to build a home while fending off the forces of the nearby forest who see their world being destroyed later he meets san a young woman raised by the clan of wolves who defend the forest as he attempts to broker an uneasy peace between the two sides princess mononoke is the epitome of miyazakis appeal to environmentalism melding traditional fantasy and japanese folklore to create the directors most serious and adult oriented work to date the films violence is a sharp divergence from miyazakis relatively goreless body of work with limbs being severed with callous abandon and wild boar gods weeping blood as they trudge on a death march through the forest its an exhilarating heartbreaking and colossal film whose message will leave audiences changed by its final scene quite simply it is everything that one would come to expect from the pedigree of hayao miyazaki 11 royal space force the wings of honnamise director hiroyuki yamaga in 1987 an upstart japanese studio called gainax pitched bandai visual on the idea of a very expensive animated film about an alternate reality in which two nation states torn by war struggle to be first to develop manned space flight in an industrialized society bandai visual who was looking to break into the film market liked the idea and thus royal space force the wings of honnamise was put into production for the the massive price tag of yen the result is essentially a two hour art film a rumination on mans capacity for greatness and evil that would end up as one of the most visually detailed animated films ever made and a flop at the box office the story concerns a young man shirotsugh lhadatt who joins the much derided space force of his nation state honnamise which is locked in perpetual war with a rival nation the republic we witness shirotsughs growth as a person and his journey to become an astronaut as well as his budding relationship with riquinni nonderaiko a young woman whose excitement about what the space program symbolizes ignites shirotsughs own passion perhaps one reason why the wings of honnamise is rarely spoken of as a masterpiece these days is the widespread critical rejection of one particular scene which has sharply divided audiences over the years in this scene shirotsugh makes his way to riquinnis house and comes close to raping her before realizing the horrible thing he is about to do and stopping himself he apologizes to riquinni who essentially tells him it was her fault for leading him on the reasons for and meaning behind the attempted rape scene and what its supposed to say about shirotsugh are sound but the reaction of riquinni makes no sense in context of the story and very much smacks of japanese cultural misogyny obviously watching these scenes with todays sensitivities in place will make them seem even more pointlessly barbaric even so regardless of how one feels about this particular scene the rest of the film is well worth critical evaluation if the wings of honnamise is a noble failure its the sort of failure many filmmakers would kill to have on their rsum j d 10 neo tokyo director various released in 1987 under the original title of manie manie labyrinth tales neo tokyo is anthology omnibus featuring shorts directed by three of the most prolific anime directors of the late rintaro yoshiaki kawajiri and of course katsuhiro otomo the collection was later renamed by streamline pictures upon its re release in 1989 to suggest a non existent tie in to otomos critically acclaimed akira which had seen a limited north american release that year rintaros labyrinth labyrinthos draws inspiration from german expressionism and the works of salvador dali depicting the story of a mischievous young girl named sachi as she and her pet cat cicerone are drawn into a dark dimension of hallucinatory oddities through the looking glass of her mothers dresser yoshiaki kawajiris the running man is a grim sci fi noir short inspired by blade runner told from the perspective of a sports reporter who witnesses the final race of zach hugh the fabled star of a deadly racing tournament who slowly develops deadly psionic abilities the final short construction cancellation order is arguably the anthologys best and most accessible entry directed by otomo the short follows tsutomu sugioka a japanese salaryman dispatched by his superiors to the remote south american country of the aloana republic to shut down their remote construction designated facility 444 labelled by both fans and critics alike as animes equivalent to francis ford coppolas apocalypse now the short is indicative of otomos social satire period which would later produce roujin z taking pointed aim at the bureaucratic absurdity of japanese working society though for the most part absent of any real thematic connectivity neo tokyo is a concise and powerful example of the dizzying heights of technical mastery and aesthetic ambition anime can achieve when put in the hands of the mediums most inimitable creators 9 my neighbor totoro director hayao miyazaki my neighbor totoro is not only miyazakis most iconic film to date its also an all but perfect family film that manages to distill the essence of childhood whimsy down to its purest state the film has a sort of timeless appeal about itself disarming audiences new and old of their cynicisms and suspicions with beautiful settings empathetic characters and an infectious marching band theme set in 1958 the film follows university professor tatsuo kusakabe and his daughters satsuki and mei as they move into an old house along the countryside in order to be closer to their mother who is recovering from a long illness we see the world through the girls eyes leaping through the fields along the house chasing skittering dust mites and tumbling down holes in the base of trees to land safely on the bulbous stomach of a benevolent spirit animal my neighbor totoro was revolutionary for its time for luxuriating on quiet contemplative moments in a time when most of anime was otherwise dominated by the chase from one flash to the next spectacle the late film critic roger ebert described it best my neighbor totoro is based on experience situation and explorationnot on conflict and threat its a film sprung fully formed from the imagination of a master animator a movie about the everyday magic of being a child and the simple power of meeting the world with an open heart 8 patlabor 2 director mamoru oshii patlabor 2 is mamoru oshiis most formative work an atmospheric political thriller that set the template for the aesthetic and mood that would later become his signature and distinguish the tone and substance of his most famous work ghost in the shell set three years after the original patlabor 2 once again follows the tokyo metropolitan police departments special vehicles unit as they are drawn into the throes of another crisis this time concerning a rogue military commanders plot to orchestrate a controlled state of fear and panic through which to mount a coup detat to overthrow the government where in his previous films oshii only flirted with political commentary that was otherwise relegated to the margins of more standard pop action plotlines patlabor 2 is a full on political thriller thats low on giant robot showdowns and heavy on ambiance emotion and careful pacing its a work of consummate technical achievement maturity and philosophical poignance as enduring today as it was nearly twenty three years ago it is the culmination of a master animator coming into the fullness of his creative faculties and the spiritual preface to the film that would later go on to become his magnum opus 7 perfect blue director satoshi kon perfect blue is a precious rarity in the genre saturation of contemporary anime an honest to god psychological horror thriller brimming with malice menace and cinematic sophistication adapted from yoshikazu takeuchis 1991 novel satoshi kons feature debut follows mima kirigoe a singer who retires from the pop idol trio that gained her fame to pursue a career as an actress as the pressures of her new career begin to take their toll a string of vicious murders perpetrated by a mysterious assailant who claims to be an agent of the real mima begins to encircle the set of her first big role as the boundaries between her private and public life begin to blur mimas grip on reality begins to fray as she stumbles spirals deeper into a tailspin of depression and madness an avowed cinephile the most visible influences for kons work on perfect blue are unmistakably that of alfred hitchcock s psycho and jonathan demmes the silence of the lambs dario argentos 1977 giallo classic suspiria is also cited by fans and critics as a possible spiritual inspiration though kon himself denied having seen any of argentos films before hearing these comparisons with exquisitely inventive editing thoughtful color direction and a gripping plot kon delivered a strong first outing as a director that would set the bar for his tremendous decade spanning career though ostensibly a film about inherent toxicity of pop culture in manufacturing idols with same infatuation as it would destroy them kon was by and large unconcerned with the surface reading of his work his interest was found beneath the folds of easy answers and trite moralizations to lay bare the truth that as one of his characters quotes from a script there are no fixed truths about ourselves only a continuous stream of memories to be ordered and rationalized 6 the wind rises director hayao miyazaki of all of miyazakis most persistent tropes and motifs there are none more consistently threaded throughout the body of work than that of the depiction of flight so its no surprise that the wind rises his eleventh and final feature film to date would focus squarely on depicting the life of japanese aviation engineer jiro horikoshi and the complicated legacy his creations relate not only to the pacifist cultural identity of contemporary japan but also on a personal level to miyazaki himself a story of how a creator cannot control what their work becomes only the dedication and craft to which they pour into the work itself the wind rises is nothing short of miyazakis final artistic testament to humanitys paradoxical capacity for both the redemptive act of creation and dogged pursuit of self annihilation a film that is in no uncertain terms a conclusion if not to miyazakis venerable career as one of the undisputed patriarchs of modern japanese animation then a thematic coda that ties together an elegant knot at the end of his venerated and storied career as a director 5 paprika director satoshi kon in a career of impeccable films paprika is arguably kons greatest achievement adapted from the 1993 novel by yasutaka tsutsui other notable novel the girl who leapt through time would form the basis of mamoru hosodas 2006 film of the same kon could not have asked for source material that better suited his thematic idiosyncrasies as a director paprika follows the story of atsuko chiba a psychiatrist working on revolutionary psychotherapy treatment involving the dc mini a device that allows the user to record and navigate ones dreams in a shared simulation by day atsuko maintains an unremittingly cold exterior but by night she moonlights as the films titular protagonist a vivacious dream detective who consults clients on her own terms when a pair of dc minis are stolen and loosed upon the world causing a stream of havoc which manifests the collective unconscious into the waking world its up to paprika and her colleagues to save the day the summation of kons decade long career as a director paprika is a cinematic trompe loeil of psychedelic colors and exquisite animation kons transition cuts are memorable and mind bending the allusions to his immense palate of cinematic influences are savvy and his appeal to the multiplicity of the human experience as thoughtful and poignant as ever unfortunately paprika would turn out to be kons last film as he would later tragically pass away in 2010 from pancreatic cancer one fact remains evident when looking back on the sum total of his lifes work satoshi kon was and remains one of the greatest anime directors of his time he will be sorely missed 4 ghost in the shell director mamoru oshii its difficult to overstate how enormous of an influence ghost in the shell exerts over not only the cultural and aesthetic evolution of japanese animation but over the shape of science fiction cinema as a whole in the century adapted from masamune shirows original 1989 manga the film is set in the mid century a world populated by cyborgs in artificial prosthetic bodies in the fictional japanese metropolis of niihama ghost in the shell follows the story of major motoko kusanagi the commander of a domestic special ops task force known as public security section 9 who begins to question the nature of her own humanity surrounded by a world of artificiality when motoko and her team are assigned to apprehend the mysterious puppet master an elusive hacker thought to be one of the most dangerous criminals on the planet they are set chasing after a series of crimes perpetrated by the puppet masters unwitting pawns before the seemingly unrelated events coalesce into a pattern that circles back to one person the major herself when ghost in the shell first premiered in japan it was greeted as nothing short of a tour de force that would later go on to amass an immense cult following when it was released in the states the film garnered the praise of directors such as james cameron and the wachowski siblings late century cyberpunk classic the matrix is philosophically indebted to the trail blazed by oshiis everything about ghost in the shell shouts polish and depth from the ramshackle markets and claustrophobic corridors inspired by the likeness of kowloon walled city to the sound design evident from kenji kawais sorrowful score to the sheer concussive punch of every bullet firing across the screen oshii took shirows source material and arguably surpassed it taking an already heady science fiction action drama and transforming it into a proto kurzweilian fable about the dawn of machine intelligence ghost in the shell is more than a cornerstone of cyberpunk fiction its more essential in this day and age than it was over twenty years ago a story about what it means to craft ones self in the digital age a time where the concept of truth feels as mercurial as the net is vast and infinite 3 grave of the fireflies director isao takahata isao takahatas grave of the fireflies is the harrowing story of two children whose lives are left devastated by the 1945 firebombing of kobe adapted from the autobiographical story of akiyuki nosaka the film follows seita a young japanese boy forced to care for his younger sister setsuko in the wake of a devastating allied attack that leaves his hometown in ruins to describe the sum of their tragedies as horrifying feels like a gross understatement the horror of grave of the fireflies is not reliant on brooding over callous acts of violence or fixating on the macabre but rather on the heart wrenching futility of seita and satsuko trying desperately to cling to some shred of normalcy in a world devoid of peace and security whether its the scene of seita setting eyes on his mother for the first time after the firebombing or satsuko inadvertently stumbling across a corpse while playing at the beach the film raises these childrens hopes of escaping a living hell on earth as quickly as it dashes them the film is extraordinary in that it shows the audience with no uncertainty that these children will perish and somehow through its hour and a half running time compels the viewer to hope that this fate can be averted grave of the fireflies is a chilling portrait of the fragility of human life when confronted by the indifferent brutality of an uncaring world a film utterly unlike anything studio ghibli had produced before or since tragic in the truest sense of the word grave of the fireflies is not only one of the greatest films the studio has ever produced but unmistakably one of the greatest anime films of all time 2 spirited away director hayao miyazaki what is it about hayao miyazakis spirited away that makes it one of his greatestif not the greatestfilms he has ever made perhaps its because the film represents the best expression of his most defining themes and concepts to date the strength and perseverance of a young woman the rapturous glory of flight the spiritual struggle of personal and cultural amnesia with japanese society the redeeming power of love or maybe it has something to do with the crux of the films story being so archetypically identifiable not so much a modern reimagining as it is a spiritual evocation of lewis carrolls alice in wonderland a childhood odyssey in a world that feels both familiar and foreign at the same time whatever the case there is nothing quite like watching spirited away for the first time the image of chihiro having discovered her parents transformed into pigs running frantically through the streets as the town surrounding her comes to life as lights flicker into existence and spirits rise up from the earth is nothing short of magical films like nausica princess mononoke and my neighbor totoro introduced the world to hayao miyazaki but it was spirited away that secured his name among the canon of the greatest animators to have ever lived and ensured his legacy for decades to come 1 akira director katsuhiro otomo the sum total of anime cinema from the early to present day is marked by the precedent of katsuhiro otomos akira adapted from the early chapters of otomos landmark manga series akira was the most expensive animated film of its time and cinematic benchmark that sent shockwaves throughout the industry set thirty one years after after world war iii was sparked by a massive explosion that engulfed the city of tokyo akira is set in the sprawling metropolis of neo tokyo built on the ruins of the former and teetering precariously on the cusp of social upheaval the film follows the stories of kaneda shotaro and tetsuo shima two members of a youth motorcycle gang whose lives are irrevocably changed one fateful night on the outskirts of the city while clashing against a rival bike gang during a turf feud
