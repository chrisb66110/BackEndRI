 hack a day electric poncho keeps you warm on the go posted mar 2012 3 by mike nathan filed under misc hacks wearable hacks with the mild winter and spring we have had it might seem strange to think about ways to keep yourself warm but theres no better time than the present to prepare for chilly weather down the line in his blog was thinking about how to keep warm when things cool off again and decided that a heated poncho would be great to have on hand he found a dead simple way to craft his heated poncho requiring little more than a bit of wiring some thread and cloth as well as a pair of scissors picked up a powered electric blanked then proceeded to cut a head sized slit in the middle of it avoiding the heating coils he sewed a bit of cloth around the hole to ensure it didnt end up ripping over time then he wired the blanket up to a battery he tucked away in his backpack the result is a variable temp poncho that you can use to keep warm in a variety of situations from hacked gadgets says that he thinks the poncho would be awesome on a full day snowmobiling trip and we think hes right continue reading to see a short video where explains how to put one of these heated ponchos together read the rest of this entry share this comments remove your s external oscillator to gain a free pair of io pins posted mar 2012 2 by mike nathan filed under arduino hacks from spikenzielabs was wrapping up a project using an arduino the other day and found himself in need of a few more i o pins he could have added extra circuitry to the project but he decided to see if he could gain a few pins by removing a few components instead he put together one of his minuino boards but rather than installing the crystal and its associated capacitors he added a couple of pin headers in their place its well known that the internal clock on the chip is not as precise as a crystal but project was not that time sensitive so he had no problem sacrificing the oscillator for a few extra pins with his new i o pins in place he merely needed to tell the atmega chip which clock it should be using and he was well on his way while this might not be the best solution for all projects out there if you are building something that values pincount over precision this hack is for you check out the video below to see hack in action hackedgadgets read the rest of this entry share this comments s first star light projector and a foil slip ring posted mar 2012 12 by brian benchoff filed under led hacks for a newborn everything is magical a lack of objectpermanence means everything is new wonderful and novel what then could be better than a projected star field circling an s room gently sending them to sleep was inspired by this earlier starlight projector that projects a rotating star field onto the walls and ceiling of a nursery instead of a rather loud servo used a quiet 12 volt gear motor that spins the star field at 5 rpm like the previous build a led was used but found a color changing rgb led that automatically shifts colors the shaft of s gear motor is tiny and unlike the servo s constant rotation this meant a slip ring was needed to pass electricity into the spinning sphere a piece of copper foil and a pair of improvised brushes served just fine while s project like its predecessor t seem to have any recognized constellations drilled into the sphere the foil slip ring opens up the possibility for a small microcontroller being fitted inside the globe with blinking lights check out the video of s build in action after the break read

microsoft showed off its golden child as the beginnings of a revolution in user interface technology the skeleton and motion detection promised a futuristic hand waving minority report interface where your entire body controls a computer the expectations t exactly lived up reality but along with his coworkers at amulet devices have vastly improved the s skeleton recognition so people can use a kinect sitting down one huge drawback for using the kinect for a minority report ui in a hometheateris the fact that the microsoft skeleton recognition t work well when sitting down instead of relying on the built in skeleton recognition that comes with the kinect rolled his own skeleton detection using harr classifiers detecting harr like features has been used in many applications of computer vision technology s a great not very computationally intensive way to detect faces and body positions with a simple camera training is required for the software and s app spent several days programming itself the results were worth it though the kinect now recognizes waving his arm while he is lying down on the couch not to outdo himself also threw in voice recognition to his kinect hometheater controller a fittingaddition as his employer makes a voice recognition remote control the recognition software seems to work very well even with the wistful scottish accent has honed over a lifetime s employer is giving away their improved kinect software that works for both the xbox and windows kinects if re ever going to do something with a kinect that t provided with the sdks and apis we covered earlier today this will surely be an invaluable resource you can check out s demo of the new kinect software after the break read the rest of this entry share this comments the first raspberry pi build is a mame machine posted mar 2012 9 by brian benchoff filed under hardware linux hacks the raspberry pi was launched nearly a month ago but these wonderful cheap single board computers are still on their way from china to the workbenches of hackers and builders around the globe although they t shipped yet plenty of people are chomping at the bit to do something useful with the raspi figured he should hit the ground running so he emulated a raspberry pi to get everything ready for the mame machine ll build when his new toy arrives found a raspi virtualbox image on the official raspberry pi forums after getting a web browser up and running with a few console keystrokes he turned his attention to a mame emulator s a relatively simple install it did take six hours to but re sure the raspi will be featured in quite a few mame builds so it was time well spent sure the raspberry pi you ordered a month ago is probably on a container ship in the middle of the ocean right now but that t mean you t start planning your build just load up a virtualbox image check out a few of the tutorials and re ready to go share this comments kinect for windows resources posted mar 2012 8 by brian benchoff filed under kinect hacks software development despite having been out for nearly two months the world has yet to see a decent guide to the kinect for windows while the xbox and windows versions of the kinect use basically the same hardware there are subtle but important differences thanks to and his awesome summary of developer resources getting your kinect project up and running is now a lot easier after getting the sdk from the microsoft kinect for windows site you might want to check out the microsoft programming guide the windows kinect can only be used with visual studio but with thatinflexibility comes a few added features both versions of the kinect have a microphone array that allows for determining the direction of a sound source the open source driver has very little support for audio input but the official microsoft version has all the apis for audio capture source localization and speech recognition ready to go at the kinect for windows is a fairly hefty investment a used xbox kinect can be had for around so re pretty certain the hacker community is going to steer itself away from the windows version still if re ever paid to develop something for the kinect you might want the friendly apis and features not found in the xbox version share this comments ancient laptop given new life as mobile prototyping platform posted mar 2012 7 by mike szczys filed under arduino hacks what can you do with a broken compaq slt 286 its briefcase like size and shape actually make for a pretty interesting portable electronic prototyping station gutted the components and started adding back the items he most commonly uses when developing a project he shares all of the details in the video after the break at center stage is a double breadboard where the keyboard would normally be found s hard to make out in the image above but there is a set of terminal strips running vertically to either side of these breadboards each terminal is connected to a peripheral or power ground bus the black knob to the left lets him adjust the output of a variable voltage regulator to the lower right s a rotary encoder push button toggle switch and a couple of potentiometers these along with the keypad and character display where the screen used to and db connectors the back of the have their pins mapped to the terminal block to the right has mounted an arduino uno over the area to the bottom left but re sure that s pretty easy to swap out for just about any breakout board he needs to answer running dialog from the video no it is not the worst demo ever we think you did a great job demonstrating all the features loose connections are par for the course when it comes to prototypes read the rest of this entry share this comments robot jellyfish fueled by hydrogen from the water around it posted mar 2012 6 by mike szczys filed under robots hacks robojelly is certainly not what re used to seeing when it comes to robots instead of a cold metallic skeleton this softie is modeled after jellyfish which have no bones but s not the only thing s unusual about it this robot also t carry its own power source it gets the energy needed for locomotion from the water around it artificial muscles are what give this the movement seen in the clip after the break these muscles react to heat and that heat is produced through a chemical reaction the construction method starts with the muscle material which is then covered in carbon nanotubes and finally coated with black platinum dust sounds a bit like witchcraft huh of newt dragon heart string etc we certainly t have the chemistry background to understand how this all works but we are impressed so far it t have the ability to change direction the flexing of all of the muscle material happens at the same time but the next step in their research will be finding a way to route the to give it some direction edit looks like it is fueled externally the actual study is here but you need to log in to download it this brings another jellyfish inspired robot to mind check out s offering which flies through the air with the greatest of ease read the rest of this entry share this
